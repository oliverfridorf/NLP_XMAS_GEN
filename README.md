This is the code used for our final Deep Learning Project. 
This repository includes all the code used and the dataset gathered for training and visualizing the model. 

xmas_func.py and SpotiPy.ipynb are used for collecting / scraping data and cleaning
The dataset used can be found in the dataset folder.

model_training_neptune.ipynb is used for creating the dataloader and training the model while saving metrics to Neptune.ai

Performance_analysis.ipynb is used to generate songs from the trained model and to visualize the results in silhouette plots and t-SNE plots.

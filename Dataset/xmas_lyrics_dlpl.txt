(Happy Christmas)
Ah, ah-ah
Ooh-woah
Oh-oh
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognise me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
"Happy Christmas," I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, "I love you," I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special, oh)
Oh, oh, baby
A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face of a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover, but you tore me apart
Ooh-ooh
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door
A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door
Sure it's Christmas once more
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing, "Let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly!"
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing, "Let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly!"
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowin' and blowin' up bushels of fun
Now, the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air
What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh
Giddyap jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell rock
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air
What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh
Giddyap jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell rock
Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Man, it doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought me some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
And the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbyeing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, and snow
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really grab me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
Oh, the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbyeing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Snow is falling
All around me
Children playing
Having fun
It's the season
Love and understanding
Merry Christmas everyone
Time for parties and celebration
People dancing all night long
Time for presents
And exchanging kisses
Time for singing Christmas songs
We're gonna have a party tonight
I'm gonna find that girl
Underneath the mistletoe
We'll kiss by candlelight
Room is swaying
Records playing
All the old songs we love to hear
All I wish that every day was Christmas
What a nice way to spend the year

I sing this song
To pass the time away
Driving in my car
Driving home for Christmas
It's gonna take some time but I'll get there
Top to toe in tailbacks
Oh, I got red lights all around
But soon there'll be a freeway, yeah
Get my feet on holy ground
So I sing for you
Though you can't hear me
When I get through

Last night I took a walk in the snow
Couples holding hands, places to go
Seems like everyone but me is in love
Santa, can you hear me?
I signed my letter that I sealed with a kiss
I sent it off, it just said this:
"I know exactly what I want this year"
Santa, can you hear me?
I want my baby, baby
I want someone to love me
Someone to hold
Maybe, maybe (maybe, maybe)
He'll be all my own in a big red bow
Santa, can you hear me?
I have been so good this year
And all I want is one thing:
Tell me my true love is near
He's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here
Santa, that's my only wish this year
Christmas Eve, I just can't sleep
Would I be wrong for taking a peek?
'Cause I heard that you're coming to town
Santa, can you hear me?
I really hope that you're on your way
With something special for me in your sleigh
Oh, please make my wish come true

My God, you look bеautiful
Right now, Merry Christmas

Christmas night, another fight
Tears, we cried a flood
Got all kinds of poison in
Of poison in my blood
I took my feet, to Oxford Street
Tryna right a wrong
Just walk away, those windows say
But I can't believe she's gone
When you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Up above candles on air flicker
Oh, they flicker and they float
But I'm up here holding on
To all those chandeliers of hope
Like some drunken Elvis singing
I go singing out of tune
Saying how I always loved you darling
And I always will
Oh, when you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Down where the sea and city meet
May all your troubles soon be gone

Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Maybe they'll bring her back to me
Then all my troubles will be gone

Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us

Run, run, Rudolph, Randolph ain't too far behind
Run, run, Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Run, run, Rudolph cause I'm reeling like a merry-go-round
Said Santa to a boy, "Child, what have you been longing for?"

Stress and holiday shopping traffic
But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else
Just like magic
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too
Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, "I love you"
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
There's a light in the barn
We run inside out from the cold
In the town, kids are dreamin' of sleighs

They wake to see a blanket of snow
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it

Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"

Snow is falling all around us
My baby's coming home for Christmas
I've been up all night inside my bedroom
He said he'll be with me real soon
So I wait
And I wait
But I've had as much as I can take
'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more dreams of you and mistletoe
Two more reasons why I love you so
I've got five more nights until you're next to me
Four more days of being lonely
Three more wishes, I can barely breathe

One more sleep (Can't believe how much I missed us)
One more sleep (One more sleep until it's Christmas)

Now I don't think I can remember
A cold and lonelier December
And I find myself singing at the window
Wondering when you're gonna get back home
So I try
And I try

Wow! Mommy's kissing Santa Claus!
I saw mommy kissing Santa Claus (kissing, kissing, Santa Claus)
Underneath the mistletoe last night
She didn't see me creep
Down the stairs to have a peep
She thought that I was tucked up
In my bedroom, fast asleep
Then I saw mommy tickle, tickle (tickle, tickle, Santa Claus)
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh, what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen

Frosty the snowman
Was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman
Is a fairytale they say
He was made of snow
But the children know
How he came to life one day
There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around
Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
Frosty the snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said let's run
And we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away
Down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler stop
Frosty the snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye
Saying don't you cry
I'll be back again some day

And he knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake!
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming
I mean a big fat man with a long white beard
He's coming to town
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look in the five and ten, glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas (Christmas)
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door
A pair of Hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make 'em ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

Do you remember me
I sat upon your knee
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies
Well I'm all grown up now
And still need help somehow
I'm not a child but my heart still can dream
So here's my lifelong wish
My grown up Christmas list
Not for myself but for a world in need
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end, no
This is my grown up Christmas list
As children we believe
The grandest sight to see
Was something lovely wrapped beneath the tree
But Heaven only knows
That packages and bows
Can never heal a heartached human soul
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end, no
This is my grown up Christmas list
What is this illusion called the innocence of youth
Maybe only in our blind belief can we ever find the truth
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end, no
This is my grown up Christmas list
This is my only lifelong wish
This is my grown up Christmas list

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
Next year all our troubles
Will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
Next year all our troubles
Will be miles away
Once again as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Will be near to us once more
Someday soon we all will be together
If the fates allow
Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now

And really that's not a lot
Been an angel all year

Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with strings
These are a few of my favorite things
Cream-colored ponies and crisp apple strudels
Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
These are a few of my favorite things
Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
Silver white winters that melt into spring
These are a few of my favorite things
When the dog bites, when the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I just simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad

The First Noel, the Angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!
They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!
And by the light of that same star
Three Wise men came from country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!
This star drew nigh to the northwest
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest
And there it did both Pause and stay
Right o'er the place where Jesus lay
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!
Then entered in those Wise men three
Full reverently upon their knee
And offered there in His presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!
Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
That hath made Heaven and earth of nought
And with his blood mankind has bought
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!
Frosty the snowman
Was a happy, jolly soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman
Is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow, but the children know
How he came to life one day
There must have been some magic in
That old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around
Oh, Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
(Frosty the snowman)
(Frosty the snowman)
He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler "Stop!"
Frosty the snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye saying "Don't you cry
I'll be back again some day"
(Frosty the snowman) Ohh-ohh
(Frosty the snowman) Ohh-ohh
(Frosty the snowman) Oh
(Frosty the snowman) Oh-oh
(Frosty the snowman) Ohh, oh-oh
(Frosty the snowman) Oh, yeah
(Frosty the snowman) Don't cry, oh-ohh
(Frosty the snowman) Oh, yeah
O little town of Bethlehem
How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight
For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God our King
And peace to men on earth
I really can't stay (But, baby, it's cold outside)
I've got to go away (But, baby, it's cold outside)
This evening has been (Been hoping that you'd drop in)
So very nice (I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice)
My mother will start to worry (Beautiful, what's your hurry?)
My father will be pacing the floor (Listen to the fireplace roar)
So, really, I'd better scurry (Beautiful, please don't hurry)
But maybe just a half a drink more (Put some records on while I pour)
The neighbors might think (Baby, it's bad out there)
Say, what's in this drink? (No cab's to be had out there)
I wish I knew how (Your eyes are like starlight now)
To break this spell (I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)
I ought to say, "No, no, no, sir" (Mind if I move in closer?)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (What's the sense of hurtin' my pride?)
I really can't stay
(Oh, baby, don't hold out)
Baby, it's cold outside
I simply must go (But, baby, it's cold outside)
The answer is no (But, baby, it's cold outside)
Your welcome has been (How lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (Look out the window at the storm)
My sister will be suspicious (Gosh your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (Waves upon the tropical shore)
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious (Gosh your lips are delicious)
But maybe just a cigarette more (Never such a blizzard before)
I've gotta get home (But, baby, you'd freeze out there)
Say, lend me a coat (It's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand (I thrill when you touch my hand)
But don't you see? (How can you do this thing to me?)
There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Think of my lifelong sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied (If you got pneumonia and died)
I really can't stay
(Get over that cold out)
Baby, it's cold
Baby, it's cold outside
Oh, by gosh, by golly
It's time for mistletoe and holly
Tasty pheasants, Christmas presents
Countrysides covered with snow
Oh, by gosh, by jingle
It's time for carols and Kris Kringle
Overeating, merry greeting
From relatives you don't know
Then comes that big night
Giving the tree the trim
You'll hear voices by starlight
Singing a yuletide hymn
Oh, by gosh, by golly
It's time for mistletoe and holly
Fancy ties and granny's pies
An' folks stealin' a kiss or two
As they whisper, "Merry Christmas" to you

For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees!
Oh, hear the angel voices!
O night divine, the night when Christ was born;
O night, O holy night, O night divine!
O night, O holy night, O night divine!
Led by the light of faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming
Now come the wisemen from out of the Orient land
The King of kings lay thus lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friends
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!
Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother
And in his name all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
With all our hearts we praise His holy name
Christ is the Lord! Then ever, ever praise we
His power and glory ever more proclaim!
His power and glory ever more proclaim!
Let me see, I'll make a list
Of the presents I have missed
Uncle Joe and Danny too
Oh and you
Wonder what I'll get for you
It must be very special too
And the moon's too big, you see
To hang it on the Christmas tree
Oh, we have so much to do
Christmas shopping, wrapping too
And we'll have a lovely tree
Wait and see
It will shine and glow with light
All gayly colored, what a sight
And we must have mistletoe
Must have a Christmas kiss, you know
Do you have candy?
Mmhm
And cookies too?
Mmhm
And nuts to crack?
Mmhm
You got gum to chew?
Yes
Will you leave something for the reindeer?
Mmhm
And something for Santa Claus too?
Oh yes
Guess you've done it all up right
Well no, not quite
Do you know a girl or boy
Who's without a Christmas toy
We could make their Christmas bright
Yes, that's right
Watch their faces, they will glow
It's really Christmas then, you'll know
If you give them love, you'll see
You'll dance around your Christmas tree
We'll dance around the Christmas tree
Watch me now
Here I go
All I need's a little snow
Starts me off
Sets the theme
Helps me dream my Christmas dream
Every year I dream it
Hoping things will change
An end to the crying
The shouting, the dying
And I hope you
Will dream it too
It's Christmas, remember
We've got to remember
So light the light
I'm home tonight
I need you to warm me
To calm me, to love me
To help me to dream my Christmas dream
Crazy things said and done
Every single day but one
Every night should, I believe
Be the same as Christmas Eve
Nights should all be silent
Days should all slow down
An end to the hurry
The noise and the worry
And I hope you
Believe that too
It's Christmas, remember
Does no one remember
The whole world needs
A Christmas dream
We need it to warm us
To calm us, to love us
To help us to dream our Christmas dream

He's gone
2,000 miles
Is very far
The snow is falling down
It's colder day by day
I miss you
The children were singing
He'll be back at Christmas time
And these frozen and silent nights
Sometimes in a dream
You appear
Outside under the purple sky
Diamonds in the snow
Sparkle
Our hearts were singing
It felt like Christmas time
2,000 miles
Is very far through the snow
I'll think of you

He's gone

Well, way up north where the air gets cold
There's a tale about Christmas that you've all been told
And a real famous cat all dressed up in red
And he spends the whole year workin' out on his sled
It's a little Saint Nick
Ooooo
It's a little Saint Nick
Ooooo
Just a little bobsled we call it old Saint Nick
But she'll walk a toboggan with a four speed stick
She's candy-apple red with a ski for a wheel
And when Santa hits the gas, man, just watch her peel
It's a little Saint Nick

Those Christmas carols by candlelight
Please, come home for Christmas (please, come home)

It was Christmas Eve babe
In the drunk tank
An old man said to me, won't see another one
And then he sang a song
'The Rare Old Mountain Dew'
I turned my face away
And dreamed about you
Got on a lucky one
Came in eighteen to one
I've got a feeling
This year's for me and you
So happy Christmas
I love you baby
I can see a better time
When all our dreams come true
They've got cars
Big as bars
They've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes
Right through you
It's no place for the old
When you first took my hand
On a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me
Broadway was waiting for me
You were handsome
You were pretty
Queen of New York City
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging
All the drunks they were singing
We kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night
The boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing 'Galway Bay'
And the bells were ringing
Out for Christmas Day

This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry
Beautiful, what's your hurry?
And father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry
Beautiful, please don't hurry
Maybe just a half a drink more
Put some records on while I pour
The neighbors might think
Baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break the spell
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
I ought to say no, no, no, sir
Mind if I move in closer
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense of hurting my pride
I really can't stay
Oh baby don't hold out
Ahh, but it's cold outside
I simply must go
But, baby, it's cold outside

Never such a blizzard before
I've got to get home
But, baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me a comb
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But don't you see
How can you do this thing to me
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my life long sorrow
At least there will plenty implied
If you caught pnuemonia and died
I really can't stay
Get over that old doubt
Ahh but it's cold outside

I know you're kinda busy with your elves right now
And I don't know how
You do the things you do while I'm 'sleep on Christmas Eve
But it's amazing
And I bet that you could bring me back my baby
Because every time I see Christmas lights
I feel this void inside and I just can't take it

And his new girl was so bleak
And then I swore to myself

Ho, ho, ho

So I hope Rudolph and them other eight reindeer
Get you safely here
So you can scoop him up and swoop him right down my chimney
I've been really, really, really good this year
So put on that red suit and make him appear
'Cause Christmas cheer
Just ain't the same without my baby

Everywhere you go;
Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door
A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas

Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year
Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
"Let It Snow" is blasting out
But I won't get in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year

Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year
You might also like
Oh, I wanna have him beside me, like oh-woo-oh
On the 25th, by that fireplace, oh-woo-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh, baby
(Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)
If he will be, if he will be here
(Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)
Oh, woah

Shake up the happiness, wake up the happiness
Shake up the happiness
It's Christmas time
There's a story that I was told
And I wanna tell the world before I get too old
And don't remember it, so let's December it
And reassemble it, oh yeah
Once upon a time in a town like this
A little girl made a great big wish
To fill the world full of happiness
And be on Santa's magic list
Shake it up, shake up the happiness
Wake it up, wake up the happiness
Come on y'all
It's Christmas time
Shake it up, shake up the happiness
Wake it up, wake up the happiness
Come on y'all
It's Christmas time
Ho, Ho, Ho
Ho, Ho, Ho
It's Christmas time
At the same time miles away
A little boy made a wish that day
That the world would be okay
And Santa Claus would hear him say:
"I got dreams, and I got love
I got my feet on the ground, and family above
Can you send some happiness with my best to the rest
Of the people of the East and the West and
Maybe every once in a while you
Give my grandma a reason to smile
'Tis the season of smile
It's cold but we'll be freezing in style
You might also like
Let me meet a girl one day that
Wants to spread some love this way
We can let our souls run free and
She can open some happiness with me"
Shake it up, shake up the happiness
Wake it up, wake up the happiness
Come on y'all
It's Christmas time
Shake it up, shake up the happiness
Wake it up, wake up the happiness
Come on y'all
It's Christmas time
I know you're out there, I hear your reindeer
I see the snow where your boots have been
I'm gonna show them, so they will know then
Their love will grow and they believe again
Shake it up, shake it up, shake up the happiness
Wake it up, wake up the happiness
Come on y'all
It's Christmas time
Shake it up, shake up the happiness
Wake it up, wake up the happiness

What are you doing New Year's, New Year's Eve?
Wonder whose arms will hold you good and tight
When it's exactly twelve o'clock that night
Welcoming in the New Year, New Year's Eve
Maybe I'm crazy to suppose
I'd ever be the one you chose
Out of the thousand invitations you received
Ah, but in case I stand one little chance
Here comes the jackpot question in advance
What are you doing New Year's, New Year's Eve?
Oh, what are you doing New Year's, New Year's Eve?
What child is this, who, laid to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping?
This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring Him laud
The babe, the son of Mary
So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh
Come, peasant, King, to own Him;
The King of kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him
This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring Him laud
The babe, the son of Mary
This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring Him laud
The babe, the son of Mary, Mary
This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring Him laud
The babe, the son of Mary
Oh yeah
Candles burning low
Lots of mistletoe
Lots of snow and ice
Everywhere we go
Choirs singing carols

Kiss you once and then some more
And wish you a Merry Christmas baby

And such happiness in the coming year

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

With every Christmas card I write
"May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white"

It ain't even cold outside, not where I'm from
Feeling like it's mid-July under the sun
My jacket don't get no love
No hats and no gloves
Not even a chance to rain
But my baby's in town, and we're gonna do some winter things
Hey, yo
I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things, hey
Take me to the ice-skating rink downtown
(No, no, no, downtown)
Even though it's 100 degrees, gotta get out
Ain't no ice or no chills
No snowmen to build
Most of our friends at the beach
But my baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things
Hey, yo
I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things, hey
Just imagine that we're laughing
In the cabin, chilling by the fireside
Even though this sun is blasting
We can be wherever if we visualize
Hey, yo

Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby

Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone astray is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No, man
But you can do the job
When you're in town
Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down
When it snows, ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way
Just walking, talking
Hand in hand in a crazy winter wonderland
Sleigh bells ring, are you listenin'
In the lane, snow is glistenin'
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a Winter Wonderland
Gone away is the blue bird
Here to stay is the new bird
He's singing our song, as we go along
Walking in a Winter Wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say "Are you married?", We'll say "No man
But you can do the job when you're in town."
Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we made

Thanks to the string of lights that make it glow
But I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas
It barely took a breath to realize
We’re going to be a classic for all time
I want to thank you baby

Sweet gingerbread made with molasses
My heart skipped and I reacted
Can’t believe that this is happening
Like a present sent from God
Sleigh bells singing Hallelujah
Stars are shining on us too
I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas
Thought I was done for, thought that love had died
But you came along, I swear you saved my life
And I wanna thank you baby
'Cause you make it feel like Christmas

You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch
You really are a heel
You're as cuddly as a cactus
You're as charming as an eel, Mr. Grinch
You're a bad banana
With a greasy black peel
You're a monster, Mr. Grinch
Your heart's an empty hole
Your brain is full of spiders
You've got garlic in your soul, Mr. Grinch
I wouldn't touch you
With a thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole
You're a vile one, Mr. Grinch
You have termites in your smile
You have all the tender sweetness
Of a seasick crocodile, Mr. Grinch
Given the choice between the two of you
I'd take the seasick crocodile
You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch
You're a nasty, wasty skunk
Your heart is full of unwashed socks
Your soul is full of gunk, Mr. Grinch
The three words that best describe you
Are as follows, and I quote:
"Stink. Stank. Stunk."
You're a rotter, Mr. Grinch
You're the king of sinful sots
Your heart's a dead tomato splotched
With moldy purple spots, Mr. Grinch
Your soul is an appalling dump heap
Overflowing with the most disgraceful assortment
Of deplorable rubbish imaginable
Mangled up in tangled-up knots

You nauseate me, Mr. Grinch

And you drive a crooked hoss, Mr. Grinch

With arsenic sauce
When the snowman brings the snow
Well he just might like to know
He's put a great big smile on somebody's face
If you jump into your bed
Quickly cover up your head
Don't you lock the doors
You know that sweet Santa Claus is on the way
Well I wish it could be Christmas every day
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play
Oh, I wish it could be Christmas every day
Let the bells ring out for Christmas
When we're skating in the park
If the storm cloud paints it dark
Then your rosy cheeks going to light my merry way
Now the frosticles appear
And they've frozen up my beard
So we'll lie by the fire
Till the sleep simply melts them all away
Well I wish it could be Christmas every day
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play
Oh, I wish it could be Christmas every day
Let the bells ring out for Christmas
When the snowman brings the snow
Well he just might like to know
He's put a great big smile on somebody's face
So if Santa brings that sleigh
All along the Milky Way
I'll sign my name on the roof top in the snow
Then he may decide to stay
Well I wish it could be Christmas every day
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play
Oh, I wish it could be Christmas every day
Let the bells ring out for Christmas
Well I wish it could be Christmas every day
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play
Oh, I wish it could be Christmas every day
Let the bells ring out for Christmas

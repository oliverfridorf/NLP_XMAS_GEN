You say I only hear what I want to
You say I talk so all the time.  So?
And I thought what I felt was simple
And I thought that I don't belong
And now that I am leaving
Now I know that I did something wrong 'cause I missed you
Yeah, I missed you
And you say I only hear what I want to
I don't listen hard
I don't pay attention to the distance that you're running
Or to anyone, anywhere
I don't understand if you really care
I'm only hearing negative, no, no, no (Bad)
And so I, I turned the radio on, I turned the radio up
And this woman was singin' my song
The lover's in love and the other's run away
The lover is crying 'cause the other won't stay
Some of us hover when we weep for the other who was
Dying since the day they were born
Well, well, this is not that
I think that I'm throwing, but I'm thrown

You try to tell me that I'm clever
But that won't take my anyhow, or anywhere with you
You said that I was naive
And I thought that I was strong
I thought, "Hey, I can leave, I can leave"
Oh, but now I know that I was wrong 'cause I missed you
Yeah, I missed you
You said you caught me ‘cause you want me
And one day you’d let me go
You try to give away a keeper but keep me
'Cause you know you're just so scared to lose
And you say, "Stay"
And you say I only hear what I want to
When I first saw you, I already knew
There was something inside of you

So honey, why don't you beg me to stay
For love and talk the way we used to talk
To we both know what we've lost
Never say the words we did before
Till it was over
Love ain't here anymore

It's gone away to a town called yesterday
Love ain't here anymore
Listen, oh, listen
I don't wanna let go (I won't let go)
So baby, we can change the way we feel
For love, and open up the way we did before
Now is the right time and I'm sure
Never say the words you did before
When it was over
Love ain't here anymore
No, no love ain't here anymore
It's gone away to that town called yesterday
Love don't live here anymore
And when I find a place for me to keep my sweet love (keep my sweet love)
Then I will leave it there forever more, yeah
And when I find someone to share
I never gave up
I will hold on, believe that
This love leads to more

Smile an everlasting smile
A smile can bring you near to me
Don't ever let me find you gone

Let's start a brand new story
Now my love
You think that I don't even mean
A single word I say
It's only words

Everywhere I look I see her smile
Her absent-minded eyes
And she has kept me wondering for so long
How this thing could go wrong
It seems to me that we are both the same
Playing the same game
But as darkness falls this true love falls apart
Into a riddle of her heart
She's so vulnerable, like china in my hands
She's so vulnerable, and I don't understand
I could never hurt the one I love
She's all I've got
But she's so vulnerable
Oh so vulnerable
Days like these no one should be alone
No heart should hide away
Her touch is gently conquering my mind
There's nothing words can say
She's colored all the secrets of my soul
I've whispered all my dreams
But just as nighttime falls this vision falls apart
Into a riddle of her heart, yeah

When I was young
I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun
Those days are gone
Livin' alone
I think of all the friends I've known
When I dial the telephone
Nobody's home
All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself
Anymore
Hard to be sure
Sometimes I feel so insecure
And loves so distant and obscure
Remains the cure

You say I only hear what I want to

And I thought what I felt was simple
And I thought that I don't belong
And now that I am leaving
Now I know that I did something wrong 'cause I missed you
Yeah, I missed you
And you say I only hear what I want to
I don't listen hard
I don't pay attention to the distance that you're running
Or to anyone, anywhere
I don't understand if you really care
I'm only hearing negative, no, no, no (Bad)
And so I, I turned the radio on, I turned the radio up
And this woman was singin' my song
The lover's in love and the other's run away
The lover is crying 'cause the other won't stay
Some of us hover when we weep for the other who was
Dying since the day they were born
Well, well, this is not that

And one day you’d let me go
You try to give away a keeper but keep me

Some people live their dreams
Some people close their eyes
Some people's destiny
Passes by
There are no guarantees
There are no alibis
That's how our love must be
Don't ask why
It takes some time
God knows how long
I know that I can forget you
As soon as my heart stops breakin'
Anticipating
As soon as forever is through
I'll be over you
Remembering times gone by
Promises we once made
What are the reasons why
Nothing stays the same
There were the nights
Holding you close
Someday I'll try to forget them
As soon as my heart stops breakin'
Anticipating

Don't wish it away

That things can only get better
And while I'm away
Dust out the demons inside
And it won't be long before you and me run
To the place in our hearts where we hide
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughin' like children, livin' like lovers
Rollin' like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Just stare into space
Picture my face in your hands
Live for each second without hesitation
And never forget I'm your man
Wait on me, girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever, I simply love you
More than I love life itself

I'm holding a fortune

I'll try to show you each and every way I can
Now and forever, I will be your man
Now, I can rest my worries and always be sure

Until the day the ocean doesn't touch the sand
Now and forever, I will be your man

And I feel my spirits rise

Is it love that I am in?
I get weak in a glance
Isn't this what's called romance?
And now I know
'Cause when I'm lost, I can let go
I don't mind not knowing
What I'm heading for
You can take me to the skies
It's like being lost in Heaven

I just fell, don't know why
Something's there we can't deny

So here I am
And can you please tell me
Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there?
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care, for me
Ooh baby
I've been around enough to know
That dreams don't turn to gold
And that there is no easy way
No, you just can't run away
And what we have is so much more
Than we ever had before
And no matter how I try
You're always on my mind
So here I am
And can you please tell me

A place where nobody dared to go
The love that we came to know
They call it Xanadu
(The tears you cried can't be denied)
And now, open your eyes and see
What we have made is real
We are in Xanadu
(The dream in you, they offer you)
A million lights are dancing
And there you are, a shooting star
An everlasting world
And you're here with me, eternally
Xanadu
Xanadu (Now we are here)

I couldn't figure why you couldn't give me what everybody needs
I shouldn't let you kick me when I'm down, my baby
I find out everybody know that you've been using me
I'm surprised you let me stay around you
One day I'm gonna lift the cover and look inside your heart
We gotta level before we go and tear this love apart
There's no fight you can't fight
This battle of love with me, you win again
So little time, we do nothing but compete
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through, you win again
Some never try, but if anybody can, we can
And I'll be, I'll be, following you (I'll be, I'll be)
Oh, girl
Oh, baby, I shake you from now on
I'm gonna break down your defenses, one by one
I'm gonna hit you from all sides, lay your fortress open wide
Nobody stops this body from taking you
You better beware, I swear
I'm gonna be there one day when you fall
I could never let you cast aside the greatest love of all
There's no fight you can't fight

Marvin, he was a friend of mine
And he could sing a song, his heart in every line
Marvin sang of the joy and pain
He opened up our minds, and I still can hear him say
"Aw talk to me, so you can see, what's going on"
Say you will sing your songs forevermore
Gonna be some sweet sounds, coming down on the nightshift
I bet you're singing proud, I bet you'll pull a crowd
Gonna be a long night, it's gonna be all right, on the nightshift

Touch me, how can it be?
Believe me, the sun always shines on TV
Hold me close to your heart
Touch me and give all your love to me, to me
I reached inside myself and found
Nothing there to ease the pressure of my ever-worrying mind, oh
All my power wasted away
I fear the crazed and lonely looks the mirror's sending me these days, oh
Touch me, how can it be?
Believe me, the sun always shines on TV
Hold me close to your heart
Touch me and give all your love to me
Please don't ask me to defend
The shameful lowlands of the way I'm drifting gloomily through time, oh (Touch me)

Thinking there's got to be some way to keep my troubles distant
Touch me, how can it be?
Believe me, the sun always shines on TV

I hear a lot of stories
I suppose they could be true
All about love and what it can do to you
Highest risk of striking out
The risk of getting hurt
And still, I have so much to learn
I know, 'cause I think about it all the time
I know, that real love has quite a price
And a good heart, these days, is hard to find (a good heart)
True love, the lasting kind
A good heart, these days, is hard to find
So please be gentle with this heart of mine
My expectations may be high
I blamed it on my youth
Soon enough, I'll learned the painful truth
I'll face it like a fighter
Then boast of how I've grown
Anything is better than being alone
I know, 'cause I learn a little every day
I know, 'cause I listen when the experts say
That a good heart, these days, is hard to find (a good heart)
True love, the lasting kind
A good heart, these days, is hard to find

As foolish as they seemed
If I don't start looking now
I'll be left behind
And a good heart these days, it's hard to find
I know, it's a dream I'm willing to defend
I know, it will all be worth it in the end

Remember when the days were long
And rolled beneath a deep blue sky
Didn't have a care in the world
With mommy and daddy standin' by
But "happily ever after" fails
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers dwell on small details
Since daddy had to fly
Oh, but I know a place where we can go
Still untouched by men
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by
And the tall grass waves in the wind
You can lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence
O' beautiful, for spacious skies
Now those skies are threatening
They're beating plowshares into swords
For this tired old man that we elected king
Armchair warriors often fail
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers clean up all details
Since daddy had to lie
Oh, but I know a place where we can go
And wash away this sin
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by
And tall grass waves in the wind
Just lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair spill all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence

But somewhere back there in the dust
That same small town in each of us
I need to remember this
So baby, give me just one kiss
And let me take a long last look
Before we say goodbye
Just lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence
Oh nah nah
Naaah
I promised myself
I promised I'd wait for you
The midnight hour
I know you'll shine on through

I promised the world to you
I gave you flowers
You made my dreams come true
How many of us out there
Feel the need to run and look for shelter?
I promised myself
That I'd say a prayer for you
A brand new tomorrow
Where all you wish comes true
I promised myself
That I'd make it up to you
My sister and brother
Know I'm in love with you
How many of us out there
Feel the pain of losing what was once there?
God I know what people say about her
No mistake who can live without love

Remember when we held on in the rain
The night we almost lost it
Once again we can take the night into tomorrow
Living on feelings
Touching you I feel it all again
Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving?
The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
Loving you makes life worth living
Didn't we almost have it all?
The night we hold on 'til the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all?
The way you used to touch me felt so fine
We kept our hearts together down the line
A moment in the soul can last forever
Comfort and keep us
Help me bring the feeling back again
Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving?

Loving you makes life worth living

Here I am
And within the reach of my hands
She's sound asleep
And she's sweeter now than the wildest dream
Could've seen her
And I watch her slipping away
But I know I'll be
Hunting high and low
High
There's no end to the lengths I'll go to
Hunting high and low

There's no end to lengths I'll go

Upon this, my dreams are depending

I sense the pounding of her heart

She's the sweetest love I could find
So I guess I'll be

I’ll be the one who brings you joy
I’ll be your hope, I’ll be your pearl
I’ll take you halfway ‘round the world!
I’ll make you rich, I’ll make you poor
Just don’t use the door
If you’re gonna do it, do it right (right)
Do it with me
If you’re gonna do it, do it right (right)
Do it with me
If you’re gonna do it, do it right (right)
Do it with me
(All day, all day)
I don't know why, I don't know how
I thought I loved you, but I'm not sure now
I've seen you look at strangers too many times
The love you want is of a different kind
Remember when we felt the sun?
A love like paradise, how hot it burned
A threat of distant thunder, the sky was red
And when you walked, you always turned every head
(All day, all day)
Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day)
Domino dancing
(All day, all day)
Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day)
(Domino dancing)
I thought that when we fought I was to blame
But now I know you play a different game
I've watched you dance with danger, still wanting more
Add another number to the score
(All day, all day)
Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day)
Domino dancing
(All day, all day)
Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day)

When you look around you wonder

Or are you just a bad loser?

I don't know why, I don't know how
I thought I loved you, but I'm not sure now
I hear the thunder crashing, the sky is dark
And now a storm is breaking within my heart
(All day, all day)
Watch them all fall down

To you, always
The love like yours is rare

For always
And we both know

I'll do my crying in the rain
Raindrops falling from heaven
Could never take away my misery

I'll pray for stormy weather

Meeting you with a view to a kill
Face to face in secret places, feel the chill
Nightfall covers me, but you know the plans I'm making
Still overseas, could it be the whole Earth opening wide
A sacred why, a mystery gaping inside
A week is why, until we...
Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
To fatal sounds of broken dreams
Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
The choice for you is the view to a kill
Between the shades assassination standing still
Earth's crystal tears, the fall of snowflakes on your body
First time in years to drench your skin in lover's rosy stain
A chance to find the phoenix for the flame
A chance to die, but can we...
Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
To fatal sounds of broken dreams
Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
When all we see is the view to a kill
I'm in love with you, girl, cause you're on my mind
You're the one I think about most every time
And when you crack a smile in everything you do
Don't you understand, girl? This love is true
You’re soft, silky hand long, sweet and thin
That candlelight complexion upon your skin
It lightens up my day, and that's oh so true
Together, we're one, separated we're two
To make you all mine, all mine is my desire
Cause you contain a quality that I admire
You're pretty plain and simple, you rule my world
So try to understand
I'm in love, girl
I'm in so love, girl
I'm just in love, girl
And this is true
Girl, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you
Yes, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you
Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you
Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you
This is some sort of thing, girl, I can't explain
My emotion starts up when I hear your name
Maybe your sweet sweet voice would ring in my ear
Then delay my system, girl, when you are near
Come with your positive emotion, love, making enjoyin
That's for me to bust it's like a girl and a boy
These feelings I get I often wonder why
So I thought I might discuss this, girl, just you and I
Now what you're wearing I don't care, as I've said before
No reason that I like you, girl, just for what you are
If I said I'd think about it, you rule my world
So try to understand
You might also like

That I'll have your heart for always
And you want me by your side
Whispering the words I'll always love you
And forever I will be your lover
And I know if you really care
I will always be there
Now I need to tell you this
There's no other love like your love
And I, as long as I live
I'll give you all the joy
My heart and soul can give
Let me hold you
I need to have you near me
And I feel with you in my arms
This love will last forever
Because I'm truly
Truly in love with you girl
I'm truly head over heels with your love
I need you, and with your love I'm free
And truly, you know you're alright with me

Miscellaneous
The Only Way Is Up
We've been broken down
To the lowest turn
And been on the bottom line
Sure ain't no fun
But if we should be evicted from our homes
We'll just move somewhere else
And still carry on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Chorus
The only way is up, baby
For you and me now, baby
The only way is up
For you and me now
Now we may not know
Where our next meal is coming from
But with you by my side
I'll face what is to come
Boy, I wanna thank you
For loving me this way
Things may be a little hard now
But we'll find a brighter day
Hold on, hold on, hold on
The only way is up, baby
For you and me now
I used to think that love was just a fairy tale
Until that first hello, until that first smile
But if i had to do it all again
I wouldn't change a thing
Cause this love is everlasting
Suddenly, life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above
And things we never take notice of
You wake up, and suddenly you're in love
Ooh yeah
Girl you're everything a man could want and more
One thousand words are not enough
To say what I feel inside
Holding hands as we walk along the shore
Never felt like this before
Now you're all I'm living for
Suddenly, life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above
And things we never take notice of
You wake up, and suddenly you're in love
Each day I pray, this love affair would last forever
Oh hoh

Just like I do? (Just like I do, hoo)
This stuff is starting now
It's the same feeling
I always seem to get around you
There's no mistaking, I'm clearly taken
By the simple mere thought of you (Oh)
This stuff is starting now (This stuff is starting now)

My eyes roll in my head
I toss and turn in my bed
In the morning when I think about you
Yes, I do
Simply put, you're the reason why
Even though I'm real shy (Real shy)
I attempt to look my best for you
Indeed, I do (Just for you)
'Cause you affect me, fascinate me
I thank heaven for the things that you do
(For the things that you do)
It's like candy (Candy), oh
You sure are sweet, sweet (Sweet)
You're so dandy (Dandy)
You're taking my appetite, but it's all right
It's like candy (Candy)
(Ooh, vanilla, oh, chocolate)
Look real nice (Real nice), wrapped up tight
You're so dandy (Dandy)

Giving me a heart attack

As the midnight moon was driftin' through
The lazy sway of the trees
I saw the look in your eyes, looking into mine
Seeing what you wanted to see
Darlin', don't say a word, 'cause I already heard
What your body's sayin' to mine
I'm tired of fast moves, I've got a slow groove
On my mind
I want a man with a slow hand
I want a lover with an easy touch
I want somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
I want somebody who will understand
When it comes to love, I want a slow hand
Ooh, ooh, ooh
On shadowed ground, with no one around
And a blanket of stars in our eyes
We are driftin' free, like two lost leaves
On the crazy wind of the night
Darlin', don't say a word, 'cause I already heard
What your body's sayin' to mine
If I want it all night, you say it's alright
Ooh, we got the time
'Cause I got a man with a slow hand
I got a lover with an easy touch
I've got somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
I found somebody who will understand
When it comes to love, I want a slow hand
Ooh, ooh, ooh
If I want it all night
Please say it's alright
It's not a fast move
But a slow groove
On my mind

Ooh, lover with a slow hand
All this time
I knew someday you'd need to find
Something that you left behind
Something I can't give you
All these tears
And like a light
Love disappears
But hearts are good for souvenirs
And memories are forever
All this time
All in all
I've no regrets
The sun still shines
The sun still sets
The heart forgives
The heart forgets
But what will I do now
With all this time
One more kiss
Even though it's come to this
I'll close my eyes
And make a wish
Hoping you remember
All this time
All in all
I've no regrets
The sun still shines
The sun still sets
The heart forgives
The heart forgets
But what will I do now

So you better treat her right
She works hard for the money

She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right
Onetta there in the corner stand
And wonders where she is
And it's strange to her
Some people seem to have everything
Nine A.M. on the hour hand
And she's waiting for the bell
And she's looking real pretty
Just wait for her clientele

She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right
Twenty-eight years have come and gone
And she's seen a lot of tears
Of the ones who come in
They really seem to need her there
It's a sacrifice, working day to day
For little money, just tips for pay
But it's worth it all
Just to hear them say that they care
She works hard for the money

All through the night
I'll be awake, and I'll be with you
All through the night
This precious time when time is new
Oh, all through the night today
Knowing that we feel the same without saying
We have no past, we won't reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends, there is no end
All through the night
Stray cat is crying, so stray cat sings back
All through the night
They have forgotten what by day they lack
Oh, under those white street lamps
There is a little chance they may see
We have no past, we won't reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends, there is no end
Oh, the sleep in your eyes is enough
Let me be there, let me stay there awhile
We have no past, we won't reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends, there is no end
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends, there is no end
Summer came and left without a warning
All at once I looked and you were gone
And now you're looking back at me
Searching for a way that we can be like we were before
Now I'm back to what I knew before you
Somehow the city doesn't look the same
I'd give my life for one more night
Of having you here to hold me tight; oh, please
Take me there again
Oh, oh
And I remember how you loved me
Time was all we had until the day we said goodbye
I remember every moment of those endless summer nights
I still recall the walks along the beaches
And the way your hair would glisten in the sun
Rising in the afternoon
Making love to you under the moon, oh
Do you remember all the nights we spent in silence
Every single breath you took was mine
We can have it all again
Say that you'll be with me when the sun brings your heart to mine
Oh, oh
Chorus
There's only so much I can say
So please don't run away from what we have together
It's only you and me tonight
So let's stay lost in flight
Oh, won't you please surrender
Chorus out
Living on free food tickets
Water in the milk
From a hole in the roof
Where the rain came through
What can you do?
Mmm
Tears from your little sister
Crying because
She doesn't have a dress
Without a patch for the party to go
But you know she'll get by
Cause she's living
In the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of a family man
(Ah, ah, yeah)
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you
Just as much as she can
(So cold)
And she can
It's a good thing you don't have bus fare
(It's a good thing, ouch)
It would fall through the hole in your pocket
And you'd lose it
In the snow on the ground
(Ow, ah, ah, yeah)
You gotta walk into town to find a job
(What's it now?)
Trying to keep your hands warm
(It's so cold)
When the hole in your shoe
Let the snow come through
And chill you to the bone
(Brrr, cha)
Somehow you'd better go home where it's warm
You might also like
Where you can
Live in a love of the common people
Smile from the heart of a family man
(Ah, ah, yeah)
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you
Just as much as she can
(So cold)
And she can
Living on a dream ain't easy
But the closer the knit
The tighter the fit
(The closer the knit)
And the chills stay away
(Ow, ah, ah, yeah)
Just to take 'em in stride for family pride
You know that faith is your foundation
(Ooh, now, ooh, now, ooh, now)
With a whole lotta love
And a warm conversation
But don't forget to pray
(Forget to pray)
Just making it strong where you belong
And we're living
In the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of a family man
(What's it now?)
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you just
As much as she can
(You're so cold)
And she can
Yes, we're living
In the love of the common people
Smile's from the heart of a family man
(Ah, ah, yeah)
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you

Smile's really hard on a family man
(Ah, ah, yeah)
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you
Just as much as she can
And she can
We walked in the cold air
Freezing breath on a window pane
Lying and waiting
A man in the dark in a picture frame
So mystic and soulful
A voice reaching out in a piercing cry
It stays with you until
The feeling has gone, only you and I
It means nothing to me
This means nothing to me
Oh, Vienna
The music is weaving
Haunting notes, pizzicato strings
The rhythm is calling
Alone in the night as the daylight brings
A cool empty silence
The warmth of your hand and a cold grey sky
It fades to the distance
The image has gone, only you and I
It means nothing to me
This means nothing to me
Oh, Vienna
This means nothing to me
This means nothing to me
Oh, Vienna
I don't know why I like it
I just do
I've been hearing your heartbeat inside of me
I keep your photo right beside my bed
Livin' in a world of fantasies
I can't get you out of my head
I've been waiting for the phone to ring all night
Why you wanna make me feel so good?
I got a love of my own, babe
I shouldn't get so hung up on you
I remember the way that we touched
I wish I didn't like it so much
I get so emotional, baby
Every time I think of you
I get so emotional, baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do?
Ain't it shocking what love can do?
Ain't it shocking what love can do?
I gotta watch you walk in the room, baby
I gotta watch you walk out
I like the animal way you move
And when you talk
I just watch your mouth
I remember the way that we touched
I wish I didn't like it so much
I get so emotional, baby
Every time I think of you
I get so emotional, baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do?

Not a word from your lips
You just took for granted that I want to skinny dip
A quick hit, that's your game
But I'm not a piece of meat, stimulate my brain
Night is young, so are we
Let's get to know each other better, slow and easily
Take my hand, let's hit the floor
Shake your body to the music, maybe then you'll score
So come on, baby, won't you show some class?
Why you want to move so fast?
We don't have to take our clothes off (Mmm...)
To have a good time, oh no

For your eyes only, can see me through the night
For your eyes only, I never need to hide
You can see so much in me
So much in me that's new
I never felt, until I looked at you
For your eyes only, only for you
You see what no one else can see
Now I'm breaking free
For your eyes only, only for you
The love I know you need in me
The fantasy you freed in me
Only for you, only for you
For your eyes only, the nights are never cold
You really know me, that's all I need to know
Maybe I'm an open book
Because I know you're mine
But you won't need to read between the lines
For your eyes only, only for you
You see what no one else can see
Now I'm breaking free
For your eyes only, only for you
The passions that collide in me
The wild abandoned side of me
Only for you, for your eyes only
Advice for the young at heart
Soon we will be older
When we gonna make it work?
Too many people living in a secret world
While they play mothers and fathers
We play little boys and girls
When we gonna make it work?
I could be happy, I could be quite naive
It's only me and my shadows
Happy in our make believe
Soon...
And with the hounds at bay
I'll call your bluff
Hey, 'cause it would be okay
To walk on tiptoes everyday
And when I think of you and all the love that's due
I'll make a promise, I'll make a stand
'Cause to these big brown eyes, this comes as no surprise
We've got the whole wide world in our hands
Advice for the young at heart

Love is promise, love is a souvenir
Once given
Never forgotten, never let it disappear

And how it makes me weep
'Cause someone sent my soul to sleep

Well
He was Thailand based
She was an airforce-wife
He used to fly weekends
It was the easy life
But then it turned around and he began to change
She didn't wonder then
She didn't think it strange
But then he got a call
He had to leave that night
He couldn't say too much
But it would be all right
He didn't need to pack - they'd meet the next night
He had a job to do
Flying to Cambodia
And as the nights passed by she tried to trace the past
The way he used to look
The way he used to laugh
I guess she'll never know what got inside his soul
She couldn't make it out
Just couldn't take ist all
He had the saddest eyes the girl had ever seen
He used to cry some nights as though he lived a dream
And as she held him close he used to search her face
As though she knew the truth - lost inside Cambodia
But then a call came through
They said he'd soon be home
She had to pack a case and they would make a rendezvous
But now a year has passed and not a single word
And all the love she knew
Has disappeared out in the haze. - Cambodia
Don't cry now - no tears now
And now the years have passed with not a single word
But there is only one thing left
I know for sure
She won't see his face again
You sheltered me from harm
Kept me warm, kept me warm
You gave my life to me
Set me free, you set me free
Of all the years I ever knew
Those finer ones I spent with you
I would give everything I own
Give up me life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again
You taught me how to cry
I don't know why, just don't know why
You told those lies to me
You set me free, you set me free
Of all the years I ever knew
Those finer ones I spent with you
I would give everything I own
Give up me life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again
Just to hold you once again
If there's someone you know
That won't let you go
And taking it all for granted
You may lose them one day
Someone takes them away
And you don't hear a word they say
I would give everything I own
Give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own

Just to hold you once again

I had to escape
The city was sticky and cruel
Maybe I should have called you first
But I was dying to get to you
I was dreaming while I drove the long straight road ahead, Uh-huh, yeah
Could taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide
This fever for you was just burning me up inside
I drove all night to get to you
Is that all right?
I drove all night, crept in your room
Woke you from your sleep to make love to you
Is that all right?
I drove all night
What in this world
Keeps us from falling apart?
No matter where I go I hear
The beating of our one heart
I think about you when the night is cold and dark
Uh-huh, yeah
No one can move me the way that you do
Nothing erases this feeling between me and yoooooou
Ohhhhhhh
I drove all night to get to you
Is that all right?
I drove all night, crept in your room
Woke you from your sleep to make love to you
Is that all right?
I drove all niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight
Could taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide
This fever for you was just burning me up
Insiiiiiiiiiiiiiiide
I drove all night to get to you (all night)

Another day is ended
And I still can't sleep
Remembering my yesterdays
I begin to weep
If I could have it over
Live my life again
I wouldn't change a single day
I wish that I could turn back the clock
Bring the wheels of time to a stop
Back to the days when life was so much better
Lying here in silence
Picture in my hand
Of a boy I still resemble
But I no longer understand
And as the tears run freely
How I realise they were the best years of my life
I wish that I could turn back the clock
Bring the wheels of time to a stop
Back to the days when life was so much better
You might say it's just
A case of giving up
No
But without these memories where is the love
(So) Where is the love?
If I could have it over
Live my life again
I wouldn't change a single day
I wish that I could turn back the clock
Bring the wheels of time to a stop
Back to the days when life was so much better
Why can't I turn back the clock
Bring the wheels of time to a stop
Back to the days
Oh no no
I remember when
Life was so good
I'd go back if I could

All at once
I finally took a moment and I'm realizing that
You're not coming back
And it finally hit me all at once
All at once
I started counting teardrops and at least a million fell
My eyes began to swell
And all my dreams were shattered all at once
Ever since I met you
You're the only love I've known
And I can't forget you
Though I must face it all alone
All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Wishing you'd come back to me
And that's all that matters now
All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Holding on to memories
And it hurts me more than you know
So much more than it shows
All at once
All at once
I looked around and found that you were with another love
In someone else's arms
And all my dreams were shattered, all at once
All at once
The smile that used to greet me brightened someone else's day
She took your smile away
And left me with just memories, all at once
Ever since I met you
You're the only love I've known
And I can't forget you

Kissing like a bandit stealing time
Underneath the sycamore tree
Cupid by the hour sends valentines
To my sweet lover and me
Slowly but surely
Your appetite is more than I knew
Sweetly, softly
I'm falling in love with you
Wish me love a wishing well, to kiss and tell
A wishing well of butterfly tears
Wish me love a wishing well, to kiss and tell
A wishing well of crocodile cheers, sing
Hugging like a monkey see, monkey do
Right beside a riverboat gambler
Erotic images float through my head
Say I wanna be (I wanna be your midnight rambler) your midnight rambler
Quickly but quickly
The blood races through my veins
Quickly, loudly
I wanna hear those sugar bells ring
Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of butterfly tears
Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of crocodile cheers, get up
On the beat now
C'mon
Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of butterfly tears, come on
Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of crocodile cheers

Things aren't quite as they
Seem inside my domain
You can't know about everything
Only pleasure and pain
You wonder why I come here
With head to my hands
Where else can I be cured
And the king of your
Mansion?
A thorn in your side
A child to protect that
Claims he's free
Just around the corner
Half a mile to heaven
Strong enough to hold you
Starved for some affection
Darling
Come quickly
Come ease my mind
For my prayers have not been
Answered in a long time
I've already made my bed
Like it or not
As long as there's no
Regrets I'll be here
When the ride stops
These comforts to me and
These crosses to bare
With which we live
Just around the corner
Half a mile to heaven
Strong enough to hold you
Starved for some affection
Baby
I can't drag you into this mess!

Pinned to my wall
An image of you and of me and
We're laughing, we're loving it all
But look at our life now
All tattered and torn
We fuss and we fight
And delight in the tears
That we cry until dawn
Oh, whoa
Hold me now, whoa
Warm my heart
Stay with me
Let lovin' start
Let lovin' start
You say I'm a dreamer
We're two of a kind
Both of us searching
For some perfect world
We know we'll never find
So perhaps I should leave here
Yeah, yeah, and go far away
But you know that there's nowhere
That I'd rather be
Than with you here today
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa

We're not scared to lose it all, security thrown through the wall
Future dreams we have to realise
A thousand sceptic hands won't keep us from the things we plan
Unless we're clinging to the things we prize
And do you feel scared? I do
But I won't stop and falter
And if we threw it all away
Things can only get better
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-whoa, whoa-oh-oh

Treating today as though it was the last, the final show
Get to 60 and feel no regret
It may take a little time, a lonely path, an uphill climb

She asked about you, I didn't quite know what to say
Heard you've been making the rounds 'round here
While I've been trying to make tears disappear
Now I'm almost over you
I've almost shook these blues
So when you come back around after painting the town
You'll see I'm almost over you
You're such a sly one with your cold, cold heart
Maybe leaving came easy, but it tore me apart
Time heals all wounds, they say, and I should know
'Cause it seems like forever, but I'm letting you go
Now I'm almost over you
I've almost shook these blues
So when you come back around after painting the town

I can forgive you, and soon I'll forget all my shattered dreams

Ooh!
Contempt in your eyes when I turn to kiss his lips

Lost in the high street, where the dogs run
Roaming suburban boys
Mother's got her hairdo to be done
She says they're too old for toys
Stood by the bus stop with a felt pen
In this suburban Hell
And in the distance a police car
To break the suburban spell
Let's take a ride and run with the dogs tonight
In suburbia
You can't hide, run with the dogs tonight
In suburbia
Break the window by the town hall
Listen, a siren screams
There in the distance like a roll call
Of all the suburban dreams
Let's take a ride and run with the dogs tonight
In suburbia
You can't hide, run with the dogs tonight
In suburbia
I only wanted something else to do but hang around
I only wanted something else to do but hang around
I only wanted something else to do but hang around
I only wanted something else to do but hang around
It's on the front page of the papers:
"This Is Their Hour of Need"
Where's a policeman when you need one
To blame the colour TV?

Summer in the city where the air is still
A baby being born to the overkill
Well who cares what people say
We walk down love's motorway
Ambition and love wearing boxing gloves
And singing hearts and flowers
But somewhere in my heart
There is a star that shines for you
Silver splits the blue
Love will see it through
And somewhere in my heart
There is the will to set you free
All you've got to be
Is true
A star above the city in the northern chill
A baby being born to the overkill
No say, no place to go
A TV, a radio
Ambition and love wearing boxing gloves
And singing hearts and flowers
But somewhere in my heart
There is a star that shines for you
Silver splits the blue
Love will see it through
And somewhere in my heart
There is the will to set you free
All you've got to be
Is true
Who could heal
What's never been as one
And our hearts have been torn
Since the day we were born
Just like anyone
From Westwood to Hollywood
The one thing that's understood
Is that you can't buy time
But you can sell your soul
And the closest thing to heaven is to rock and roll

(No no no no)
(Never say, never say)
(Say goodbye, no no no)
I never can say goodbye, no no no, I
I never can say goodbye
Every time I think I've had enough
And start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
Piercing me right to the core
It says "turn around you fool
You know you'll love him more and more"
Tell me why (Tell me why) is it so?
Don't want to let you go
No, I never can say goodbye boy, ooh, no no
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no, no no no, ooh, ooh

I keep thinking that our problems
Soon are all gonna work out
But there's that same unhappy feeling
There's that anguish, there's that doubt
It's that same old dizzy hang up

I know all there is to know about the crying game
I've had my share of the crying game
First there are kisses
Then there are sighs
And then, before you know where you are
You're sayin' goodbye
One day soon, I'm gonna tell the moon about the crying game
And if he knows, maybe he'll explain
Why there are heartaches (Heartaches)
Why there are tears (So sad)
Then what to do to stop feeling blue
When love disappears

In my imagination
There is no complication
I dream about you all the time
In my mind, a celebration
The sweetest of sensation
Thinking you could be mine
In my imagination
There is no hesitation
We walk together hand in hand
I'm dreaming
You fell in love with me
Like I'm in love with you

Because it's only make believe
And I would come a-running
To give you all my loving
If one day, you would notice me
My heart is close to breaking
And I can't go on faking
The fantasy that you'll be mine

I don't want half-hearted love affairs
I need someone who really cares
Life is too short to play silly games
I've promised myself I won't do that again
It's got to be perfect
It's got to be worth it, yeah
Too many people take second best
Well I won't take anything less
It's got to be, yeah, perfect

They're much too eager to give their love away

When I first saw him standing there
I longed to speak but did not dare
Something inside whispered to me
You'd better move in carefully
And then he smiled and turned away
That told me all he could not say
That's when I knew he wanted me too
But I had to do some breaking through
He's so shy
He's so shy
That sweet little boy who caught my eye
He's so shy
He's so shy
And he's much too good to let get by
Oh yes he is
Now holding him gently through the night
Nothing has ever felt so right
And I'm so glad I took the time
That I had to take to make him mine
He can still do things to my heart
Just like he did right from the start
Each time I see that quality
That never stops attracting me
He's so shy (so good lookin')
He's so shy (yes he's really got me goin')
That sweet little boy who caught my eye
He's so shy (I'm so glad I got to know him)
He's so shy ('cause he's a one in a million)
That I'll love him 'til the day I die
Oh yes I will
He's so shy (That's why I love my baby)
He's so shy (You know it's drivin' me crazy)
That sweet little boy who caught my eye (I said)
He's so shy (took a long time to know him)
He's so shy (and I'm so glad I got to show him)
That I'll love him 'til the day I die
Oh yes I will

What would I have to do
To get you to notice me too?
Do I stand in line?
One of a million admiring eyes
Walk a tightrope way up high
Write your name across the sky
I'm going crazy just to let you know
You'd be amazed how much I love you so, baby
When I get my hands on you, I won't let go
This time I know it's for real
Should I write or call your home?
Shout it out with a megaphone?
Radio, TV news
Got to find a way to get the message to you
Say I love you with a neon sign
Anything to make you mine

Sure in time our eyes would meet
And like a bridge that's on fire, the hurt is over
One touch and you set me free

Guess there are times when we all need to share a little pain
And ironin' out the rough spots
Is the hardest part when memories remain
And it's times like these when we all need to hear the radio
'Cause from the lips of some old singer
We can share the troubles we already know
Turn 'em on, turn 'em on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone (ah...)
Why don't you tune in and turn them on?
They reach into your room, oh
Just feel their gentle touch (gentle touch)
When all hope is gone (ooh)
Sad songs say so much
If someone else is sufferin' enough, oh, to write it down
When every single word makes sense
Then it's easier to have those songs around
The kick inside is in the line that finally gets to you
And it feels so good to hurt so bad
And suffer just enough to sing the blues
So turn 'em on, turn 'em on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone (ah...)
Why don't you tune in and turn them on?
They reach into your room, oh
Just feel their gentle touch (gentle touch)
When all hope is gone (ooh...)
You know sad songs say so much
Sad songs, they say

I won't be here when you come home
I'm sorry if you don't understand, forgive me if you can
But I can see another road
And I ain't coming back
Don't look for me around this town
Cause I will be so far away you'll never find me anywhere
And I won't take no souvenirs, no perfume picture promises
Because it's over
And I ain't coming back
You gave me everything
And now I'm breaking your heart
You know that I don't mean
To tear your world apart
I would never leave, if I thought you couldn't stand the pain
A letter in hall, is written on the wall
A letter with no words of love at all
Because it's over (because it's over)
And I ain't coming back
And as I close the door
I know I'm breaking your heart
I should have loved you more
Instead I've torn your world apart
And as I walk into the lonely afternoon
I feel sad enough, I feel bad enough
And all the times when you are lonely where you are
Please don't hate me then, I just could not pretend
Oh, no

Go on, mmmm, that's good!
Now the tambourine, right now!
Mmmm, woo, yeah, DJ!
Who's that gigolo on the street
With his hands in his pockets and his crocodile feet?
Hanging off the curb, looking all disturbed
And the boys from home, they all came running
They were making noise, manhandling toys
There's the girls on the block with the nasty curls
Wearing padded bras sucking beers through straws
Dropping down their drawers, where did you get yours?
Gigolo
Huh, sukka?
Gigolo. Gigolo
Huh, sukka?

What a change if we set the pace, face to face
No one even trying to score
Oh, oh, I can feel the magic of your touch
And when you move in close a little bit means so much
Ooh, yeah, you've got to understand, baby

Just you and me, you and me, you and me (On one)
Inside, everyone hides one desire
Outside, no one would know
Danger, close to the edge of the knife
Safer not to let go
And while we miss chances
You can almost hear time slipping away
We close our eyes, we never lose a game
Imagination never lets us take the blame
We close our eyes to see the final frame
We close our eyes to time slipping away
No show, Wednesday girl waits with the wine
She knows just what to say
While no one listens
You can almost hear time slipping away
We close our eyes, we never lose a game
Imagination never lets us take the blame
We close our eyes to see the final frame
We close our eyes and
We can talk to strangers
We are burning with the spark
And we can walk on water
We are tigers in the dark
We are burning
We close our eyes
Heroes never give in to the night
He knows how far he can run
And as he surrenders
You can almost hear time slipping away

Watch out!
I see you on the street, and you walk on by
You make me wanna hang my head down and cry
If you gave me half a chance
You'd see my desire burning inside of me
But you choose to look the other way

For something I want
Don't try to resist me
Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darling
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key
I think that you're afraid to look in my eyes
You look a little sad, boy, I wonder why
I follow you around, but you can't see
You're too wrapped up in yourself to notice
So you choose to look the other way
Well, I've got something to say

How, how can it be that a love
Carved out of caring, fashioned by fate
Could suffer so hard
From the games played once too often?
But making mistakes
Is a part of life's imperfections
Born of the years
Is it so wrong to be human after all?
Drawn into the stream
Of undefined illusion
Those diamond dreams
They can't disguise the truth
That there is something about you
Baby, so right
I wouldn't be without you, baby, tonight
If ever our love was concealed
No one can say that we didn't feel
A million things
And a perfect dream of life
Gone, fragile but free
We remain tender together
If not so in love
It's not so wrong
We're only human after all
These changing years
They add to your confusion
Oh, and you need to hear
The time that told the truth
That there is something about you
Baby, so right
Don't want to be without you
Baby, tonight
Because there's something about you
Baby, so right
I couldn't live without you
Baby, tonight
I know there's something about you
And I couldn't live without you tonight
When life is too much, roll with it, baby
Don't stop and lose your touch, oh no, baby
Hard times knocking on your door
I'll tell them you ain't there no more
Get on through it, roll with it, baby
Luck'll come and then slip away
You've gotta move, bring it back to stay
You just roll with it, baby
Come on and just roll with it, baby
You and me, roll with it, baby
Hang on and just roll with it, baby, hey
The way that you love is good as money
I swear by stars above, sweet as honey

When you're in love, you know you're in love
No matter what you try to do
You might as well resign yourself
To what you're going through
If you're a hard man or if you're a child
It still might get to you
Don't kid yourself, you've seen it all before
A million mouths have said that too, ooh
I've had my hard times (hard times!) in the past
I've been a husband and a lover too
I've laid alone and cried at night
Over what love made me do
And the loved ones who let me down
And couldn't share my point of view
But this is Phil talking, I wanna tell you
What I found to be true
I love your love action
Lust's just a distraction
No talking, just looking
Watching your love action
I believe, I believe what the old man says
Though I know that there's no Lord above
I believe in me, I believe in you
And you know I believe in love
I believe in truth, though I lie a lot
I feel the pain from the push and shove
No matter what you put me through
I'll still believe in love, and I say

You've got me so confused and there's words I could use
But I'm afraid to say them
I feel I've been had and I'm boiling mad
Still I can't live without you
You don't have the time and you won't spend a dime
Not even to call me
Oh, you don't know I exist and I wouldn't be missed
If I had the nerve to quit you
Invisible, I feel like I'm invisible
You treat me like I'm not really there
And you don't really care
I know this romance, it ain't goin' nowhere
Invisible, you treat me like I'm invisible
When you get the need to flirt
You do the worst
You just don't care how much it hurts
I can never reach ya on the phone
It rings and rings when I know you're home
It may be naive but I just wanna believe
I'm the only one
I tell myself lies and give you alibies
Knowin' your promises you'll never keep
Like the merry go round I'm goin' up, goin' down
I'm on a dead end street
Invisible, I feel like I'm invisible
You treat me like I'm not really there
And you don't really care
I know this romance, it ain't goin' nowhere
Although, I know it's not a lot
Don't want to lose whatever we've got
I keep hangin' on, knowin' I can't win
'Cause it's too hard to start over again
Invisible, I feel like I'm invisible
You treat me like I'm not really there
And you don't really care
I know this romance, it ain't goin' nowhere
Invisible, you treat me like I'm invisible
When you get the need to flirt, you do the worst

Ah, touch me, touch me
This is the night
Touch me, touch me
I wanna feel your body
Full moon in the city and the night was young
I was hungry for love, I was hungry for fun
I was hunting you down, and I was the bait
When I saw you there, I didn't need to hesitate
This is the night, this is the night
This is the time we've got to get it right (This is the night)
Touch me, touch me I wanna feel your body
Your heartbeat next to mine (This is the night)
Touch me, touch me now
Quick as a flash, you disappeared into the night
Did I hurt you boy? Didn't I treat you right?
You made me feel so good, made me feel myself
Now I'm alone and you're with somebody else
This is the night, this is the night
This is the time we've got to get it right (This is the night)
Touch me, touch me I wanna feel your body
Your heartbeat next to mine (This is the night)
Touch me, touch me now
Touch me, touch me now
Touch me, touch me now
Hot and cold emotion, confusing my brain
I could not decide, between pleasure and pain
Like a tramp in the night, I was begging for you
To treat my body like you wanted to
Oh, I was begging for you (This is the night)

Woke up this morning
Closed in on all sides
Nothing doing
I feel resistance
As I open my eyes

You can look at the menu
But you just can't eat
You can feel the cushions
But you can't have a seat
You can dip your foot in the pool
But you can't have a swim
You can feel the punishment
But you can't commit the sin
And you want her and she wants you
We want everyone
And you want her, and she wants you
No one, no one, no one ever is to blame
You can build a mansion
But you just can't live in
You're the fastest runner
But you're not allowed to win
Some break the rules
And let you count the cost
The insecurity is the thing that won't get lost
And you want her and she wants you
We want everyone
And you want her, and she wants you
No one, no one, no one ever is to blame
You can see the summit
But you can't reach it
It's the last piece of the puzzle
But you just can't make it fit
Doctor says you're cured
But you still feel the pain
Aspirations in the clouds
But your hopes go down the drain
And you want her and she wants you
We want everyone
And you want her, and she wants you
No one, no one, no one ever is to blame
No one ever is to blame
No one ever is to blame
I've been through so many changes in my life woman
It's a wonder I ain't lost my mind
And I ain't never said how much I need you sugar
But I sure need you by my side
My love, just thinking about you baby
Just blows my mind
My love, just thinking about you baby
Just blows my mind all the time
Life with me I know for sure it ain't been easy
But you stayed with me anyway
And even though you ain't gonna lose too much by leaving
I'm so glad you stayed

Nothing is so good it lasts eternally
Perfect situations must go wrong
But this has never yet prevented me
Wanting far too much
For far too long
Looking back
I could have played it differently
Won a few more moments
Who can tell
But it took time to understand the man
Now at least I know
I know him well
Wasn't it good?
(Oh so good)
Wasn't he fine?
(Oh so fine)
Isn't it madness
He can't be mine?
But in the end
He needs a little bit
More than me
More security
He needs his fantasy and freedom
I know him so well
No-one in your life is with you constantly
No-one is completely on your side
And though I'd move my world to be with him
Still the gap between us is too wide
Looking back
(Looking back)
I could have played it differently
(I could have played it some other way)
Learned about the man
Before I fell
(I was just a little careless)
But I was ever so much younger then
(Maybe, so much younger then)

I know him well

It was a theme she had
On a scheme he had
Told in a foreign land
To take life on earth
To the second birth
And the man was in command
It was a flight on the wings
Of a young girl's dreams
That flew too far away
Don't push too far your dreams are china in your hand
Don't wish too hard because they may come true
And you can't help them
You don't know what you might have set upon yourself
China in your hand
Come from greed
Never born of the seed
Took a life from a barren hand
Oh eyes wide
Like a child in the form of man
A prophecy for a fantasy
The curse of a vivid mind
Don't push too far your dreams are china in your hand
Don't wish too hard because they may come true
And you can't help them

Don't push too far your dreams are china in your hand

Tell me lawyer what to do
I think I'm falling in love with you
Defend me from the way I feel
Won't you give me some advice
On how to handle my private life
I'm sure that we can make a deal
I confess I'm a fool for men
With a clever mind
But your intellect ain't no match
For this heart of mine
All I want is a little reaction
Just enough of to tip the scales
I'm just using my female attraction
On a typical male, on a typical male
Your sense of justice I'll embrace
But your defense don't help my case
I'm deep in trouble with the law
Something about authority
Seems to bring out the bad in me
Hey lawyer got to catch me when I fall
Oh they say that you match your wits
With the best of them
But I know when I'm close you're just
Like the rest of them
All I want is a little reaction
Just enough of to tip the scales
I'm just using my female attraction
On a typical male, on a typical male
So put your books aside
Loosen off the suit and tie
And open up your heart and let me in

In a fleeting moment of a restless day
Driven to distraction, I was captured by the game
I have often wondered why I ever wanted to
Leave these scattered hours behind me and speed myself to you
I choose never to forget
I want our lips to kiss and our limbs to entwine
Let our bodies be twisted but never our minds
Is this love?
Is this love?
Is this love?
Is this love?
Set to work idle hands, shake these thoughts had I planned them
They never would be teasing me as viciously as these
I would not have believed you had I never seen
Now you and I are intimately pictured in my dreams
I could not forsake you or fall tumbling away
And if I live in wonderland, I'm better off this way
I choose never to forget
I want our lips to kiss and our limbs to entwine
Let our bodies be twisted but never our minds

Joining our hands, united we're stronger
Fighting for peace, caring about our loved ones
Trusting ourselves, sharing our feeling, believe me

It's not just emotional feeling
I need you body and soul
You give me one good reason to leave me
I'll give you ten good reasons to stay

I said "Hey boy, what's with the frown?"
But in return, all you could say was
"Hi George, meet my fiancee"

In 1965, Vietnam seemed like
Just another foreign war
But it wasn't, it was
Different in many ways
As so were those
Who did the fighting

Combat soldier was twenty-six
In Vietnam, he was nineteen

According to a Veteran's Administration study
Half of the Vietnam combat veterans suffered
From what psychiatrists call
Post traumatic stress disorder
Many vets complain of alienation, rage, or guilt
Some succumb to suicidal thoughts

It's dark and cold tonight
I'm walking all alone
And one step at a time
I'm getting closer
I know she's hard to find
Instinctively I try
To take the path of love
Into the night
There would be no reason
If you really didn't care
There would be no reason for love
The door is open wide, is anybody there?
I know this must be the room in your heart
I really don't know why but it's so easy to breathe
I know this must be the room in your heart
No answers question me
No one's been here before
I'm the first to see
The light at your door
If I could hold you now
I wouldn't disagree
With these four walls
You're protecting me
There would be no reason
If you really didn't care
There would be no reason for love
The door is open, is anybody there?
I know this must be the room in your heart
I really don't know why but it's so easy to breathe

I only want to learn what you know
But now you're leaving...
How many hearts must you break?

All that I choose has come unbearable
But love is in your touch
Ooh, it's killing me so much
Only when you leave
I need to love you
And when the action has all gone
I'm just a little fool enough to need you
Fool enough too long
Only when you leave

So give a little passion to a stranger
And take this soul away
I only want to make things last
So how could this have gone so fast?
And now you're leaving...
How many times must I learn?
It's only when you've gone that I burn
And now you're leaving...
In the end
All that is left has come unbearable
It's hard to change your mind

Each time you break my heart
Each time you break my heart
I know how it feels to be the talk of the town
I'm not gonna let you go and run around
I need to know that you'll be true to me
'Cause that's the way it's got to be
Why can't you give your promise to me
Is love so blind that you cannot see

No matter what you do or say
I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you anyway
And if you're so sure that I'm not your kind
How come you can't just walk away
In the beginning we were nothing but glad
Those were the best days that we ever had
There's no compassion, all your warmth is gone
Tell me how, oh, how can I keep holding on

I was living in a world of make believe
When my best friend wrote and told me
That there may be a job in the city
And you never told me
He would dream about another scheme
About another sordid hall of dreams
About a man who's king of industry
He would swear by his mouth almighty
He would buy the best
But never something new
And he never told me
I like kicking in the gutter and
Wishing I was lucky
Wishing I was lucky, wishing I was lucky
Oh I like kicking in the gutter
Wishing I was lucky, wishing I was lucky
It's the only life I know
Lie, lie, lie is all you ever do
To make me want to push on through
Cry, cry, cry cry is all I ever do
Say that's how you want to make me push on through
I like kicking in the gutter and
Wishing I was lucky
Wishing I was lucky, wishing I was lucky

Down by the riverside
It's bound to be a better ride than what you've got planned
Carry a cup in your hand
Look around
Leaves are brown
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter
Hang onto your hopes, my friend
That's an easy thing to say, but if your hopes should pass away
Simply pretend
That you can build them again
Look around
Grass is high
Fields are ripe
It's the springtime of my life
Seasons change with the scenery
Weaving time in a tapestry
Won't you stop and remember me?

OK, you're on your own, it's late
Your girlfriend is on another date
With the hero in your dream
Turn around, ask yourself
So you think you're gonna win this time, manchild?

Manchild, manchild, manchild
From Monday down to Friday
You're working on another man's car
Or is it in the factory?
It doesn't matter where you are
Just turn around and ask yourself, is this communication?
Accentuate the positive to give some illustration
See, manchild, you're no one, I'll turn the microphone on
Control communication when I'm kicking it and so on
To the point where I need the air that I breathe
Into an audience that's waiting and ecstatic to receive
For the meantime another mean rhyme, I keep on saying it
I know what the time is and the crowd will keep on playing it
Through the speaker boxes. Loud's my diagnosis
'Cause I believe in miracles and words in steady doses
Enough R-E-S-P-E and C-T
Respect yourself, express, no stress, the mike is easy
Just believe that all you need is the air that you breathe

Yeah, oooh, oooh, oooh
Girl, you'd better let go, come on
'Cause they say (I owe you nothing)
I won't walk out
Friends say I'll get over you soon
Thoughts of you come back to fill me with gloom
Time forgets, but I'm not over you yet
There's no sense in asking why
Until the tears run dry
There's no one but you on my mind
Searching for a perfect ending that we'll never find
If we could make it work this time
Years have flown by since you've been gone
This broken heart of mine's been waiting too long
All alone without you I can't carry on
There's no sense in asking why
Until I'm there by your side
There's no one but you on my mind
Searching for a perfect ending that we'll never find
If we could make it work this time
We could plant tomorrows dreams now together
In a garden to last forever more
And the flowers would grow
From the seeds we'd sow...
There's no one but you on my mind
Searching for a perfect ending that we'll never find
If we could make it work this time
There's no sense of asking why
Until the tears run dry
I could be there by your side
If you would only change your mind
If we could make it work this time
I have a tale to tell
Sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well
I was not ready for the fall
Too blind to see the writing on the wall
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
'Til then, it will burn inside of me
I know where beauty lives
I've seen it once, I know the warm she gives
The light that you could never see
It shines inside, you can't take that from me
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
'Til then, it will burn inside of me
The truth is never far behind
You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell the secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again?
If I ran away, I'd never have the strength to go very far
How would they hear the beating of my heart?
Will it grow cold, the secret that I hide? Will I grow old?
How will they hear? When will they learn? How will they know?
A man can tell a thousand lies

Ooh, whoa
Put your hand on your heart

But another to make it last
I thought that we were just beginning
And now you say we're in the past
Oh, look me in the eye
And tell me we are really through
You know it's one thing to say you love me
But another to mean it from the heart
And if you don't intend to see it through
Why did we ever start?
Oh, I wanna hear you tell me

Wish I could find the right words to say
Losing control
And it’s over you
Nobody else can make me feel this way
Could it just be that I’m curious
And I wanna make you play my game
But something tells me that it’s serious
Because I go insane
When I hear your name
I’m hooked on you
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

It’s over you
I try to hide it
But I know it’s true
My body trembles when I look in your eyes
I’m so turned on
I don’t know what to do
It seems your touch can make my temperature rise
Can it just be that I’m curious
And I wanna make you play my game
But something tells me that it’s serious

They used to say that boys are tough as nails
In every way he keeps his heart as guarded as a jail
Now things have changed, I feel so old
Like any girl could drag my heart across the coals
I was always there in the thick of things
I always had the heart of every woman on a string
The danger zone shone from my eyes
It seemed like every inch I gained became a mile
It's not the night reaching in and touching me
It's just that breaking hearts ain't what it used to be
It seems that time has killed that cruel streak in me
And breaking hearts ain't what it used to be
It's not the light shining in and catching me
It's just that breaking hearts ain't what it used to be
But time has come and cast a spell on me
And breaking hearts ain't what it used to be
And now I know what lonely means
I used to give so little and gain everything
The darkest part of every day
Is the shadow of another girl as she turns and walks away
Can't say I blame them all for being hurt
After all I treated each and every one like dirt
Who wants a heart that's never home
I face the facts and lock myself into a life alone

One, two
One, two
One, two, three, four
Hold it
Now!
You, you've been gone for so long

It's that ole devil called love again
Gets behind me and keeps giving me that shove again
Putting rain in my eyes, tears in my dreams
And rocks in my heart
It's that sly old sun of a gun again
He keeps telling me that I'm the lucky one again
But I still have that rain, still have those tears
And those rocks in my heart
Suppose I didn't stay, ran away, wouldn't play
The devil, what a potion he would brew?
He'd follow me around, build me up, tear me down
'Till I'd be so bewildered, I wouldn't know what to do
Might as well give up that fight again
I know darn well he'll convince me that he's right again
When he sings that sorry song I'm just gonna tag along
With that ole devil called love
He'd follow me around, build me up, tear me down
With that ole devil called love
What's the matter with the way we look?
Surely it's not the end
I only meant to make my motions clear
You worry too much if it's understood
Should we be seen as friends?
Seems like a real good beginning right here
'Cause when your heart is weak
I'm gonna pick the lock on it
My fingertips won't fail me
No matter what you do
The love you cannot see yet
Is about to witness a dawning
And you can twist and turn
But you won't get loose
Better forget getting rid of me
I don't see how you can
You put me off and I will hunt you
Down...again
I'm mighty patient when I have to be
You have given me that
Still I look forward to the day you let me in
'Cause when your heart is weak
I'm gonna pick the lock on it
My fingertips won't fail me
No matter what you do
The love you cannot see yet
Is about to witness a dawning
And you can twist and turn
But you won't get loose
I'm gonna prove myself worthy
No more just hanging on
Without a prayer of a chance
I'm gonna come without warning
When your defenses are down and you're in
A desperate need
Oh, I bet you then, you'll welcome me...

Women of a certain age

You can look at the menu
But you just can't eat
You can feel the cushions
But you can't have a seat
You can dip your foot in the pool
But you can't have a swim
You can feel the punishment
But you can't commit the sin
And you want her and she wants you
We want everyone
And you want her, and she wants you
No one, no one, no one ever is to blame
You can build a mansion
But you just can't live in
You're the fastest runner
But you're not allowed to win
Some break the rules
And let you count the cost
The insecurity is the thing that won't get lost
And you want her and she wants you
We want everyone
And you want her, and she wants you
No one, no one, no one ever is to blame
You can see the summit
But you can't reach it
It's the last piece of the puzzle
But you just can't make it fit
Doctor says you're cured
But you still feel the pain
Aspirations in the clouds
But your hopes go down the drain
And you want her and she wants you
We want everyone
And you want her, and she wants you
No one, no one, no one ever is to blame
No one ever is to blame
No one ever is to blame
Your hair hangs in golden steps
You're a bonafide in every respect
You are walking through streets that mean nothing to you
You believe you're above it and I don't really blame you
Maybe that's why you speak like a child;
The things you're saying like "I'm so free and so wild"
And I believe it when you look in my eyes;
You offer me a life, and never lies
Least only the kind to make me smile
Your clothes are clean and your mind is productive
It shops in store where only the best buy
You're cool and hard, and if I sound like a lecher
It's probably true
But at least there's no lecture
I really like it when you speak like a child
The crazy sayings like "I'm so free and so wild"
You have to make a bargain with me now
A promise that you won't change somehow
No way, now how
Spent all day thinking about you
Spent all night coming to terms with it
Time and conditions are built to tame
Nothing lasts with age, so people say
But I will always try to feel the same
I really like it when you speak like a child
I really like it when you speak like a child

Set
Set
Set me free !
Flash backs hits me right between the eyes
The man just came and said to me: I want you by my side
Something so excited but not without a doubt
He's locked the door and thrown the key
Someone get me out
I know he means no harm to me
But building walls confining me
Can only make me wanna leave - set me free !
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free !
Falling crashing in and out of love
Doing things that girls do
Then he came about
So delightful all that I could want
But he locked the door and threw the key
Won't you let me out?
I know he means no hann to me
But building walls csnfining me
. . 
Set me free

Let me go ! I said let me go ! Set me free !

Lonely people gathering there to be one
Gonna be the last time wasted
Gonna be seen to be gone
Run a mile for the minute
Gonna mind another day without you in it and you
You promised me paradise
Don't go back on your word
No, you
You promised me paradise
All my days of loving you under my skin
Gonna be a wild, wild world
When nobody wants to give in
Gonna call me on the hour
Gonna mind if I don't hear it
I would hate to be you
You promised me paradise
Don't go back on your word
No, you
You promised me paradise
Can you tell me if there's gonna be another reason to cry
Will I be the last to know
Unless we make another way of doing what we do we won't believe it anymore
Will I be the one to cry
Problems, problems haunting me, circle my head
Gonna be a wild world, let me hide away under your bed
Run a mile for the minute
Gonna mind another day without you in it and you

Your sweet nature, darling
Was too hard to swallow
I've got the solution
I'm leaving tomorrow
And now as I stand
And stare into your eyes
I see safety there
I want surprises
What I really need to do
Is find myself a brand new lover
Somebody with eyes for me
Who doesn't notice all the others
What I really need to do
Is find a brand new lover
When you wake up tomorrow
You'll be all alone
Oh the love that we had
I have quickly outgrown
I wanted to stay, but I just couldn't do it
Couldn't stand there and put you through it

I'm nothing but a pleasure-seeker
For once I really must agree
I need to leave you by yourself
And go in search of someone else
To satisfy my curiosity
Your sweet nature, darling
Was too hard to swallow
I've made my decision
I'm leaving tomorrow

Looking from a window above
It's like a story of love, can you hear me?
Came back only yesterday
We're moving farther away, want you near me
All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew, only you
Sometimes when I think of your name
When it's only a game and I need you
Listening to the words that you say
It's getting harder to stay when I see you
All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew, only you
All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew, only you
This is gonna take a long time
And I wonder what's mine, can't take no more
Wonder if you'll understand
It's just the touch of your hand behind the closed door
All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew, only you
I just got your message, baby
So sad to see you fade away
(What in the world is this feeling
To catch a breath and leave me reeling?)
It'll get you in the end, it's God's revenge
Oh, I know I should come clean
But I prefer to deceive
(Every day I walk alone
And pray that God won't see me)
I know it's wrong
I know it's wrong
Tell me why
Is it I'm digging your scene?
I know I'll die
Baby
They put you in a home to fill in
Oh, but I wouldn't call that living
(I'm like a boy among men
I'd like a permanent friend)
I'd like to think that I was just myself again
Oh, tell me why

What's another year?
I've been waking such a long time
Reaching out for you
But you're not near
What's another year?
What's another year
To someone who's lost everything that he owns?
What's another year
To someone who's getting used to being alone?

There's a man I meet walks up our street
He's a worker for the council
Has been twenty years
And he takes no lip off nobody
And litter off the gutter
Puts it in a bag
And never thinks to mutter
And he packs his lunch in a "sunblest" bag
The children call him "bogie"
He never lets on
But I know cause he once told me
He let me know a secret about the money in his kitty
He's gonna buy a dinghy
Gonna call her dignity
And I'll sail her up the west coast
Through villages and towns
I'll be on my holidays
They'll be doing their rounds
They'll ask me how I got her I'll say " I saved my money"
They'll say isn't she pretty that ship called dignity
And I'm telling this story
In a faraway scene
Sipping down raki
And reading Maynard Keynes
And I'm thinking about home and all that means
And a place in the winter for dignity
And I'll sail her up the west coast
Through villages and towns
I'll be on my holidays
They'll be doing their rounds
They'll ask me how I got her I'll say "I saved my money"

I'm tired of playing on the team
Ooh, it seems I don't get time out anymore
What a change if we set the pace, face to face
No one even trying to score
Oh, oh, I can feel the magic of your touch
And when you move in close a little bit means so much
Ooh, yeah, you've got to understand, baby
Time out is what I'm here for
One on one, I wanna play that game tonight
One on one, I know I wanna play that
One on one, I wanna play that game tonight
One on one, so slow, ooh
You can't tell me you don't miss me girl, no

I wanna play with you, girl (On one), I wanna play with you, girl (On one)
Just you and me, you and me, you and me (On one)
Inside, everyone hides one desire
Outside, no one would know
Danger, close to the edge of the knife
Safer not to let go
And while we miss chances
You can almost hear time slipping away
We close our eyes, we never lose a game
Imagination never lets us take the blame
We close our eyes to see the final frame
We close our eyes to time slipping away
No show, Wednesday girl waits with the wine
She knows just what to say
While no one listens
You can almost hear time slipping away
We close our eyes, we never lose a game
Imagination never lets us take the blame
We close our eyes to see the final frame
We close our eyes and
We can talk to strangers
We are burning with the spark
And we can walk on water
We are tigers in the dark
We are burning
We close our eyes
Heroes never give in to the night
He knows how far he can run
And as he surrenders
You can almost hear time slipping away

Two people living on the edge of life
Are people running out of dreams and time
I can hear it when you tell me so
And I can feel it but I can't let go
Two people got to stick together
And love one another, save it for a rainy day
Some people got to stay whatever
And give one another shelter on a rainy day
Two people living in the way we do
Are people trying to keep a love anew
What to say to make some sense of it
And what to do to make the feeling fit
Ill come running to your rescue
You got to stand by me
Theres a lot of love between us
And we should never let go, oh
Two people, stick together
One another, save it for a rainy day
Some people stay whatever
How did you know
'Cause I never told
You found out
I've got a crush on you
No more charades
My heart's been displayed
You found out
I've got a crush on you
You must have heard it from my best friend
She's always talking
When she should be listening
Can't keep a secret to save her life
But still I trusted her
With all I felt inside
I never knew
A rumor could spread so fast
'Cause now the word is out
All over town
That I'm longing for you
Maybe I was the one who left the trace
Was there a message written on my face?
Were my emotions so easily read
That you would know my love
Before a word was said
Was it my eyes
That let you know you had control?
Because the way you move
Was so self-assured
You knew I would surrender

This is the last time
I'll look across this table
And try to face a feeling I don't even recognize
This is a sad hand
That reached across and touched you
When all we'd built around us came crashing to the ground
There was a tide turning
Somewhere deep inside us
When all these years together seem lost behind my tears
Oh there were good times
But in between the dog days
I felt the pain of rumour whisper in my ears
But I still tried to love you
I still tried to care
Still tried to hold on with the power of my prayers
But you can't fight the rumour
You can't argue with you heart, no
Once the rumour spreads, once the rumour spreads
Once the rumour spreads, the truth is just a thing of the past
As the rain falls
I listen to the radio
And try to memorize the words to "Georgia On My Mind"
But we're no old song
We never stood the test of time
The lies inside the rumour left trust so far behind
But I still tried to love you
I still tried to care
Still tried to hold on with the power of my prayers
But you can't fight the rumour
You can't argue with you heart, no
Once the rumour spreads, once the rumour spreads
Once the rumour spreads, the truth is just a thing of the past
And when we say goodbye
Be sure to look me in the eye
And know the real secret
Was the thing we didn't have to hide

For so long
I kept these feelings for you locked up inside
And there were nights that
I would cry myself to sleep and wonder why
Now I don't wanna tell you how to live
Don't wanna put the blame
But don't you think
It's time for you and I
To try to make a change
We can't go wrong
(Loving one another)
We can't go wrong
(Caring for each other)
We can't go wrong
If the love we have is real
We can't go wrong
There was a time when things were better
Than the way they are today
But we forgot the vows we made
And love got lost along the way
Now I can tell just by the way
You look at me that you feel the same
So don't you think it's time for
You and I to try to make a change

And you need to move about
But I was taught that boys need girls and girls need boys
You say that's not true
You'd rather fool around than be alone with me
Well, that's alright for you
Cause you got love, love
Love on your side
Cause you got love, love
Love on your side
Cause you got love, love
Love on your side
Cause you got love, love
Love on your side
I've bought you sentimental roses
But you gave them all away
I've played you all my favorite records
Then we spent the night in talking, talking all the time...
You sent me home
I was so surprised to find that after all
It doesn't hurt to be alone
Cause you got love, love
Love on your side
Cause you got love, love
Love on your side
Cause you got love, love
Love on your side
Cause you got love, love

Well all the things you say make perfect sense to me
Somehow I'm still unsure
Then I catch myself going through the same old rhapsody
RAP BOY RAP!
And I don't understand just what I'm doing to myself
I guess that's nothing new

Though I live on the edge, time is on my side
All the doors to my life are open wide
Just as long as the wheels keep on turning 'round
I will live for the groove 'til the sun goes down
(Living it up, living it up) I can feel it
(Living it up) Is it a crazy notion?
(Living it up, living it up) I can feel it
(Living it up) I got forward motion
I don't wanna go to war
I don't wanna go to war
I said, I know what I want
And I don't wanna go to war
Do you follow me?
I saw a soldier standing in a bar
Looked so tired, he'd come so far
He said, "I need to love someone
Before they drop the atom bomb"
There's a girl at the back making eyes at me
And her hair, long and black, is a sight to see
But I get kind of scared when love's around
I just live for the groove 'til the sun goes down
(Living it up, living it up) I can feel it
(Living it up) Is it a false emotion?
(Living it up, living it up) I can feel it
(Living it up) I got forward motion
So I'm a-taking you out, but I'm a-faking
I'm married to the beat, to the music I gave
The heart I could have given you
Still there's something 'bout the way that you move
And the way the people stare, it's the shock of the new
I want my friends to see me standing next to you

I get out of bed at half past ten
Phone up a friend who's a party animal
Turn on the news and drink some tea
Maybe if you're with me we'll do some shopping
One day I'll read or learn to drive a car
If you pass the test you can beat the rest
But I don't like to compete or talk street, street, street
I can pick up the best from the party animal
I could leave you, say goodbye
Or I could love you, if I try
And I could
And left to my own devices, I probably would

Learn to ignore what the photographer saw

Stick with the gang if you want to belong
I was a lonely boy, no strength, no joy
In a world of my own at the back of the garden
I didn't want to compete or play out on the street
For in a secret life I was a roundhead general

The way I like to picture you
When I get home it's late at night
I pour a drink and watch the fight
Turn off the TV, look at a book
Pick up the phone, fix some food
Maybe I'll sit up all night and day
Waiting for the minute I hear you say

Another dollar, another day
Same old routine in my way
My eyes are achin', my body tired
I'm all strung up you know, I feel so wired
And then you walk, into the room
Time stops, everything drops, boom boom boom
Visions of love, heavens above!
I feel your body like a velvet glove, because...
You're a sight for sore eyes
As a matter of fact
At the drop of a hat
You're my love surprise
So radical, so very chic
But without you I feel so weak
When loverboy comes into sight
I don't know why but it feels so right
Need energy, a vitamin shock?
No way for me, you're what I got
Don't need no drugs, to make me high!
I just need to look you baby right in the eye, because...

He was a very special warm and gentle person
Who put in music in the world and spoken in rhyme
And it hurts me that I never really knew him
'Cause all it would have taken was some time

And when mountains got too steep for me to climb
And it tears me up to think I never touched him

Gettin' no, no, nowhere

Zephyr in the sky at night, I wonder
Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun?
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder threatens everyone
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
Faster than the speeding light she's flying
Trying to remember where it all began
She's got herself a little piece of heaven
Waiting for the time when Earth shall be as one
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
Zephyr in the sky at night, I wonder
Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun?
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder threatens everyone
And I feel
Quicker than a ray of light, then gone for
Someone else will be there

And she pours herself another cup of coffee
As she contemplates the stain across the wall
And it's in between the cleaning and the washing
That's when looking back's
The hardest part of all
And she always did her best to try and please him
While he always did his best to make her cry
And she got down on her knees to stop him leaving
But he always knew one day he'd say goodbye
Where are your friends
Where are your children
Is this your house
Is this your home
Does nothing ever last forever
Does everybody sleep alone
And he tears the business tags from his old suitcase
As he packs away the pieces of his life
They all love him but they always try to change him
That's what happens when a girl becomes your wife
And she pours herself another cup of coffee
As the pictures leave a clean space on the wall
And it's in between the leaving and the loving
That's when looking back's
The hardest part of all
Where are your friends
Where are your children
Is this your house

Does nothing ever last forever
Does everybody sleep alone
Alone

Give a smile from your lips and say
I am free, yes I'm free
Now I'm on my way
You got to be fortunate, you got to be lucky now
I was just sitting here; thinking good and bad
But I’m the kind of woman that was built to last
They tried erasing me, but they couldn’t wipe out my past
To save my child I’d rather go hungry
I got all of Ethiopia inside of me
And my blood flows through every man
In this godless land that delivered me
I’ve cried so many tears even the blind can see
This is a woman’s world… This is my world
This is a woman’s world for this man’s girl
There ain’t a woman in this world, not a woman or a little girl
That can’t deliver love in a man’s world
I’ve born and I’ve bred; I’ve cleaned and I’ve fed
And for my healing wits I’ve been called a witch
I’ve crackled in the fire and been called a liar
I’ve died so many times; I’m only just coming to life
My blood flows through every man and every child
In this godless land that delivered me
I cried so many tears even the blind can see
Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know
When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
That's what my mama told me
'Round and 'round and 'round you go
When you find love, you'll always know
I let my father mold me
Daddy couldn't be all wrong
(Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there)
And my mama made me learn this song
(You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you)
That's why
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know
The deeper I go
"All is fair in love," she said
"Think with your heart, not with your head"
That's what my mama told me
All the little things you do
Will end up coming back to you
I let my father mold me
Daddy couldn't be all wrong

Kisses sent from heaven above

Someone said that romance was dead
And I believed it instead of remembering

Then you tried to hold me
You remind me what they said

You're the future, and you've come for what is yours

You ain't never gonna feel this way
You ain't never gonna know me
But I know you...
Teach you now that
Things can only get better
Can only get, can only get
They get on from here
You know, I know that
Things can only get better
I sometimes lose myself in me
I lose track of time
And I can't see the woods for the trees
You set them alight, burning the bridges as you go
I'm too weak to fight you
I got my personal health to deal with
And you say
Walk my path
Wear my shoes
Talk like me

He came from somewhere back
In his long ago
Sentimental fools don't see
Tryin' hard to recreate
What had yet to be created
Once in their lives
She musters a smile
For a nostalgic tale
Never comin' near what he wanted to say
Only to realize
It never really was
She had a place in his life
He never made her think twice
As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He's watching her go
But what a fool believes
He sees
No wise man has the power
To reason away
What seems
To be
Is always better than nothing
And nothing at all
Is sending him somewhere back
In his long ago
Where he can still believe
There's a place in his life
Someday, somewhere
She will return
She had a place in his life
He never made her think twice

Nothing really mattered to me
But making myself happy
I was the only one
Now that I am grown
Everything's changed
I'll never be the same
Because of you
Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me
Looking at my life
It's very clear to me
I lived so selfishly
I was the only one
I realize
That nobody wins
Something is ending
And something begins
Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to
Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you

Like they're trying to prove it won't fall out
And all the men are gargoyles
Dipped long in Irish stout
The whole place is pickled

This could be Rotterdam or anywhere

'Cause Rotterdam is anywhere
Anywhere alone

And everyone is blonde
And everyone is beautiful
And when blondes and beautiful are multiple

And when faced with dull and dutiful

Battle khaki personality
With red underwear

Millennium
Some say that we are players
Some say that we are pawns
But we've been making money
Since the day that we were born
Got to slow down
'Cause we're low down
Run around in circles
Live a life of solitude
Till we find ourselves a partner
Someone to relate to
Then we'll slow down
Before we fall down
We've got stars directing our fate
And we're praying it's not too late
'Cause we know we're falling from grace

Live for liposuction
And detox for your rent
Overdose at Christmas
And give it up for Lent

Refuse to keep the faith

No I don't lack ambition
Can't you see what I hate
That it's you who is sinking
Locked behind iron gates
You should know, you're falling into fiction
I can tell you're on some foolish mission
Your black eyed soul, you should know
That there's nowhere else to go
My black eyed boy, you will find
Your own space and time
You call me superstitious
Tie me up with your deceit
I can never be malicious
Though I seem so bittersweet

If the night turned cold and the stars looked down
And you hug yourself on the cold cold ground
You wake the morning in a stranger's coat
No one would you see
You ask yourself, who's watched for me
My only friend, who could it be
It's hard to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me
When your belly's empty and the hunger's so real
And you're too proud to beg and too dumb to steal
You search the city for your only friend
No one would you see
You ask yourself, who's watched for me
A solitary voice to speak out and set me free
I had to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me
You're not the easiest person I ever got to know
And it's hard for us both to let our feelings show
Some would say I should let you go your way
You'll only make me cry
If there's one guy, just one guy
Who'd lay down his life for you and die
I Hate to say It
I hate to say it, but it's probably me
When the world's gone crazy and it makes no sense
There's only one voice that comes to your defense
And the jury's out and your eyes search the room
And one friendly face is all you need to see
If there's one guy, just one guy
Who'd lay down his life for you and die
I Hate to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me

More than you want me
I never understood
Maybe I have never had you
I have been lonely for you lately
I can't wait another day
And when you let me get you close to me
You run and leave me
Paying the price of love
The start of my end over you
When you're doin' it for someone
Who'll never be free
Now is all there will ever be
No more to live without you
All the nights I dream about you
Deep in the dark of the night
I'm a man on a mission
But safer with you home
Never would I make you sorry
You are the only drug I crave
And I've been saving everyday
I held it all inside, I pray
You don't forget you got me
Paying the price of love
My heart in my hands over you
But the battle is just not fair
You'll never be free
That emotion is always replaying
You know the strongest heart
Is broken when it falls
You turn and walk away
And let it die
I got this picture in my head
Of you in someone else's bed
And I am torn apart
I'm torn apart inside

MC's, disc jockeys
To all the fly kids and the young ladies
Introducing the crew ya got to see to believe
We're one, two, three, four, five MC's
I'm Melle Mel and I rock it so well
And I'm Mr. Ness because I rocks the best
I'm Rahiem in all the ladies' dreams
And I'm Cowboy to make ya jump for joy
I'm Creole, solid gold

Dig this, we're the Furious Five plus Grandmaster Flash
Giving you a blast of sho'nuff class
So to prove to ya all, we're second to none
We're gonna make five MC's sound like one
Ya gotta dip dip dive, so-so-socialize
Clean out your ears and then open your eyes
And then pay at the door as a donation
To hear the best sounds in creation
He's a disco dream of a mean machine
And when it comes to size, ya see what we mean
Ya see his name is not found in the hall of fame
But he'll shock and amaze and make ya feel shame
He takes a lime from a lemon
A-from a lemon to a lime
He cuts the beat in half the time
And as sure is three times two is six
You'll say Flash is the king of the quick mix
We're five MC's and we're on our own
And we're the most well known on the microphone
And we throw down hard and we aim to please
With finesse to impress all the young ladies
We got rhymes galore and that's a fact
And the satisfaction guaranteed to cause a heart attack
We are the best as you can see
So eliminate the possibility
That to be an E-M-C-E-E
Is not a threat to society
Say step by step, stride by stride
I know the fly young lady would like to ride
In my Mercedes, young ladies
My Mercedes, young ladies
If my Mercedes break down and dog my grill
I will-a drive up in a new Seville
If my Seville break down, I'll take it on back
I will-a dog my grill in a new Cadillac
My Cadillac break down, I'm just too much
I will-a shock your mind in a new Star Stutz
And if a Stutz break down, I'll make another choice
I will-a dog my grill in a new Rolls Royce
And if my Royce break down, I'll be out in the rain
And then forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it
Forget it, huh, take the train
Take the train, take the train
Can't, won't, don't stop, rockin' to the rhythm
'Cause I, I get down, 'cause I, I get down, 'cause I, I get down
Ladies who don't know my name
And you fellas who don't know my game
Yes, I'm called the prince of soul
But others call me The Kidd Creole
The MC delight, young ladies bite
When I'm on the mic, I rock the house right
I'm the dedicated prince, heart of solid gold
Rockin' to the rhythm while I'm playing the role
A cool calm customer, the master plan
It takes a sucker's man to try to jump my hand
And the things I do and what I say
Affect a lot of people in the strangest way
Makes them clap their hands and say "Alright"
It's Creole to the broad daylight
Mr. Ness, my mellow, what it look like
When ya on the mic?
Let's a rock y'all, a let's a rock the house
Because the Furious Five are gonna turn it out
So young ladies, if you think ya heard
You heard the best rap, you heard the best word
Yes, it's true that we got the fuss
Because it can't be the best unless it came from us
There's five of us and we take no stuff
We coming through the city, we coming through rough
We number one ain't nothin' you can do
And if you wanna get down, we'll rock you too
So free-formin y'all, you don't stop
Come on, come on and let me see-a rock rock
Cowboy, they say you're from the Bronx

They call me Keith-Keith the young ladies' relief
Know as the man of romance and make you dance
Can any of you ladies stand a chance?
I'm Cowboy and I'm shockin' the house, you see?
Ya say one, two, one more is three
A-Melle Mel, come on, now what ya got for me?
To the hip hop, a hip hop, a-don't stop
A-don't stop that body rock
A-just get up out your seat and get ready to clap
Because-a Melle Mel is starting to rap
And ever since I talked at my very first party
I felt I could make myself somebody
It was something in my heart from the very start
I could see myself at the top of the chart
Rapping on the mic, making cold, cold cash
With a jockey spinnin' for me called DJ Flash
Signing autographs for the the young and old
Wearing big time silver and solid gold
My name on the radio and in the magazine
My picture on the TV screen
It's ain't like that yet, but, huh, you'll see
I got potential and you will agree
I'm coming up and I got a step above the rest
'Cause I'm using that ladder they call success
You say a-one, two, three, four, five, six, seven
Rap like hell and make it sound like heaven
A seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
A-come on, Rahiem, come and get some
Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, come on
Come on, huh, I wanna hit the top

I know I'm in all of the ladies' dreams
I'm the R-A-H to the I-E-M
I'll put a wiggle in your butt if ya tell me when
I'm the son of a gun with the hell of a fire
Fly girls that mess around, I'll take ya all higher
My clientele climbed a great big boost
I'm to give it up and turn it loose, huh
All you fly girls that don't know my game
Come up and talk to me and we'll tell you all the same
When ya wake up in the night in a hell of a dream
You know ya been possessed by the voice of Rahiem
In all the ladies' dreams
And makin' more currency than any MC
And the dream will turn to reality
And Melle Mel'll be makin' money
Mr. Ness, make-makin' money
Rahiem, makin' money
Cowboy, make-makin' money
A-Creole, makin' money
DJ Flash, make-makin' money
Hit it
Take the time and you will agree
That Black Door got good security
So when you walk through the door, just do me a favor
Be sure to be on your best behavior
Young man, what do you wanna do
When the party is through
And a young lady wanna go home with you?
You search your pocket, ya soon aware
That you don't have enough for cab fare
Then you say to yourself what a mistake ya made
Your heart start pumpin' that ol' Kool-Aid
When she walks to you and she starts to say
"Call One-Double-O, he's down with O.J."
And you pay the way
Young ladies a-like, young ladies galore
Young ladies we do adore
From the way they move and the way they smile
It makes me admire their grace and style
There is not room for disbelief
That's the only way that The Kidd Creole can relieve
Or rock the house
I'm a Scorpio and I will not flow
I need ten fly girls before I go
Now when the night is done
You come and get some
Then you meet Mr. Ness and you have some fun
'Til you walk up real soon
And you head for my place and when you get in my room
You touch my face and then you start to chase
And then you grab em' by the waist
And then I lay you right back, I'm on a steady pace
I'm the only go of the rodeo
Ya say I ride in the rain 'til it's time to go
I'm the buckaroo of the boogaloo
All the young ladies roll when he pass through
I got two jazzy ladies in deep, deep check
Both ladies in the discotheque
I got one in the front and one behind
I'm in the middle 'cause they're both mine
A-yes, yes, y'all, you don't stop that body rock
From the shores of California to the streets of New York
Ain't nothing sweeter than ya walk except the way you front
You got hair everywhere, skin so fair
A dynamic personality, a lot of flair
With your flashy clothes and your photogenic pose
You're as sharp as a thorn on the stem of a rose
So petite and elite you're, huh, too sweet
So great I'm amazed that you can't be beat
The way you swerve your curves, it really wrecks my nerves
You're everything that a man deserves
So women of the world, amen to thee
Because women like you make men like me
Yes, yes, y'all, you don't stop
Come on, come on, huh, I wanna hit the top
Young ladies out there I won't be surprised
If I catch you watchin' or starin' in my eyes
Come a little closer and you're sure to find
That I'm a hell of a fella and I'm one of a kind
If you happen to stare for just about a hour
You sweet young thing, you'll be in my power
Don't fight the feelin', it's nothin' you could do
Except watch your back (Huh), 'cause I'm gonna pursue
If you think that you can't contain yourself
Well, put all the silly games right up on the shelf
Come here, ya sexy figure, tell ya what I'm gonna do
I got a hell of a proposition just for you
Gonna stick the lovin' to ya, baby, later for a kiss
If you pass the chance up, you know you just missed
Beyond the shadow of a doubt, or anything you can believe
If you so deep in the forest that you can't see the trees
Creole, my mellow
It's on you so what you gonna do?
You say I rock the house, make other MC's run
Place a bet with this devil, cheat 'em for a hun'
Con any con man with bat or bowl
I go by the name of The Kidd Creole
I'm the king of finesse, I'm here to rock the rest
All the young ladies I wanna impress
When I rap on the mic, I guarantee
A certain amount of consistency
Like Flash we'll cut the record to the bone
Creole will rock on the microphone
Mr. Ness, my mellow
Come and get some 'cause we're number one
Don't stop y'all, a-let me see ya rock
We gonna rock to the sounds around the clock
We gonna move to the beat, but don't you dare stop
Come on everybody, stop playin' around
Because you got to get up so we can get down
Unless you too hot to trot and not ready to rock
Come on-on and dance and give me what you got
Because you know by now you got to give me something
'Cause after all, you sweeter than honey
Get down on your behalf
Because you gotta do it do for your calfs
A-Cowboy, they say you from the Bronx
So won't you rock and add a little spunk?
Yes, yes, y'all, you don't stop
A-come on girl, let's hit the top
Like a .357 pointed towards your head
Cowboy just about ready for the bed
So pull back the covers and take down your pants
'Cause Cowboy will make you Patty Duke dance
A side to side and you pat ya foot
Get up out ya seat, then you shake your butt
You say one, two, one more is three
A-Melle Mel, come on, what you got for me
You don't stop that body rock
They say a child is born with no state of mind
He's blind to the ways of mankind
God is smilin' on you, but he's frownin', too
Because only God knows what you'll go through
You'll grow in the ghetto livin' second-rate
Your eyes will sing a song of deep hate
The places you play and where you stay
A-looks like one great big alleyway
You'll admire all the number-book takers
Thugs, pimps, and pushers, they're the big money makers
Drivin' big cars, spendin' twenties and tens
And you wanna grow up to be just like them, huh
Smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpocket, peddlers, even panhandlers
You say, "I'm cool," huh, "I'm no fool"
But you'll wind up droppin' outta high school
Now you're unemployed, all non void
Walkin' around like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stick-up kid, and look what you done did
Got sent up for an eight year bid
Now your manhood is took, you're a Maytag
Spend the next two years as a undercover fag
Bein' used and abused, served like hell
'Til one day you was found hung dead in a cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad, song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young
Sayin', one, two, three, four, five, six, seven
Rap like hell and make it sound like heaven
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
Now come on Raheem, a-come and get some
Yes, yes, y'all, you don't stop
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon and let me see you rock
I'm only five-foot-nine, you think I care?
I can pull a girl from anywhere
'Cause I'm bubblin' 'round, just the talk of the town
When they talk about me, they don't dare frown
'Cause I'm too hot to trot, to cold to walk, uh
To all the fly girls, I'm aimin' to talk
To all the fly girls, you got to beware
'Cause Raheim, huh, will be in yo' hair
Just come on to the roast and listen to me
Because everybody knows Raheem is what it be
Melle Mel (Bang), rock the house (Pow)
Come on, help me turn it out
A-Mr. Ness (Bang), rock the house (House)

Someday I'm coming back, and it won't be long
Before you call me and tell me to come home
Someday I'm coming back, and it won't be long
Before I'm home, home and in your arms
What did I do, my darling, that made you send me running
Told you to cast me down and throw me out
What can I tell you, honey, If I don't know what I've done
All I can hope is that you ask me to come back home
Someday I'm coming back, and it won't be long
Before you call me and tell me to come home
Someday I'm coming back, and it won't take long
Before I'm home, home and in your arms
Even in stormy weather, we always stuck together
You always kept me near, were so sincere
So why so sudden the change of heart
Why do I feel like I've done wrong
When all that I want is that you ask me to come back home
Someday I'm coming back, and it won't be long
Before you call me and tell me to come home
Someday I'm coming back, and it won't be long

Once in a lifetime you find
Someone to show you the way
Someone to make your decisions
But I let you lead me astray
Who did you think you were fooling
Said you were missing me blind
But the truth is I knew you were lying
You were using me time after time
When the heartache is over
I know I won't be missing you
Won't look over my shoulder
'Cause I know that I can live without you
Oh live without you
Oh I can live without you
Time to move on with my life now
Leaving the past all behind
I can make my own decisions
It was only a matter of time
Sometimes I look back in anger
Thinking about all the pain
But I know that I'm stronger without you
And that I'll never need you again
Live without you
I can live without you 
I saw you walk down the street
With some other girl
Always thought that I was the only one in your world
Baby can you tell me so
Out of sight out of mind ain't what love ought to be
And I hoped all the time that you'd be faithful to me
Faithful to me
All I'm asking you for when you walk out the door
Is to be my baby, baby
I just want to be sure
That forever and more
You would be my baby
Love is just like a flower baby it has to grow
And when you are away I'm even loving you more
I just have to let you know
One on one is the way and that's the way it should be
So if you're not gonna stay
Then don't be playing with me
You can set me free
All I'm asking you for when you walk out the door
Is to be my baby, baby
'Cause all this love is for you
And you know that I'm true
And I'll be your baby
All I'm asking you for when you walk out the door
Is to be my baby, baby
'Cause you knew from the start
That you were working my heart
Won't you be my baby
I remember our walk the other Saturday night
Sweet harmonies filled and floated through our minds
Never felt this way before
We were riding so high an love and understanding
So why go wasting your time when you have got such a find
That is everlasting

CHORUS:
Everybody in the house of love
Everybody in the house of love
One love, one God
Everybody in the house of love
We've got to stop the pain, and put the wars on hold
Let the power of love, inside the soul unfold
Free the mind, let it rise above
We've got to change this world to a world of love
Mother Earth she's on overload
One more war and she might explode
We've got to look back and see a love from the past
We've got the time to change it but it's running out fast
BRIDGE:
Not bothered about your colour, concerned about your creed
In the house of love, everybody's free
Not bothered about your colour, concerned about your creed
In the house of love, everybody's free
CHORUS x2
How many more tears must she cry
How many more fears must be felt inside
Before we realise we're going too far
The Creator created, we tore it apart
But love can guide us back to the right road
We gotta save the planet, before she explodes
We've got to love our mother gotta let her know
Boom, boom, before she blows
Not bothered about religion, not bothered about belief
In the house of love, everybody's free
Not bothered about religion, not bothered about belief
In the house of love, everybody's free
CHORUS x2
Born to live, we live to die
Our eyes can't see they can only cry
But our mother's tired of crying, she's had enough
She's gonna surely blow, 'cause we're giving up
Build the house of love while we've got the time
Too many bombs in a world it's like a living mine
The house of love is what we must build
The past won't lost if the present is killed!

¿Dónde está el hombre con fuego en la sangre?
I've got a secret, I cannot keep it
It's just a whisper of a distant memory
Just a dream, or so it seems
Take me back to the place I'd rather be
You left a fire in my eyes
That lightens up the darkest skies
I'm giving up, I'm letting go
I'll find my way so
Take me back to my sweet la vida
Find my love, my dolce vita
Show me where I need to go

My eyes are open to this lifelong mystery
And so I'll go with what I know
Take my chances and run with destiny
Now there's fire in my eyes
I break away and say goodbye

And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel
I feel love

We've come so far
And we've reached so high
And we've looked each day and night in the eye
And we're still so young
And we hope for more
We've come a long way
But we're not too sure where we've been
We've had success
We've had good times
But remember this
Been on this path of life for so long
Feel I've walked a thousand miles
Sometimes strolled hand in hand with love
Everybody's been there
With danger on my mind I would stand on the line of hope
And I knew I could make it
Once I knew the boundaries I looked into the clouds and saw
My face in the moonlight
Just then I realised what a fool I could be
Just cause I looked so high I don't have to see me
Finding a paradise wasn't easy but still
There's a road going down the other side of this hill
Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream
Safe from the arms of disappointment for so long
Feel each day we've come too far
Yet each day seems to make much more
Sure is good to be here

Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

We're only people
We're only people

We're not invincible
So again I'll tell you
Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream
Never, everybody sing, oh baby
Never, no never, never forget for love
Someday, louder, louder, louder, louder loud
Never, everybody sing that song
Never, yeah, louder, louder, louder, louder loud
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream
We've come so far and we've reached so high
And we've looked each day and night in the eye
And we're still so young and we hope for more
Hot summer streets

I love her body, especially the lies
Time takes its toll, but not on the eyes
Promise me this, take me tonight
If he's extra large, well I'm in charge
I can work this thing on top
If he's XXL, well what the hell
Every penny don't fit the slot
Ah, the anorexic chicks, the model six

Well, eight or nine, well that's just fine

Freedom comes when you learn to let go
Creation comes when you learn to say no

Pain is a warning that something's wrong

I wake up in a dream
Echoes in my head make every whisper turn into a scream
I dreamed I could fly out in the blue
Over this town followin' you
Over the trees, subways and cars
I'd try to find out who you really are
In the middle of the night (middle of the night)
Cool sweatin' in my bed
Got the windows open wide, thinkin'
About all the things you said
I wish I could fly out in the blue
Over this town followin' you

Who you really are

I wish I could fly now

I'll be the queen and you'll be the king (Uh-oh)
Hey boy, in your tree
Throw down your ladder, make a room for me (Uh-oh)

I'll show you mine if you show me yours

My breath smells of a thousand fags
And when I'm drunk I dance like me Dad
I've started to dress a bit like him
And early morning when I wake up
I look like Kiss but without the make up
And that's a good line to take it to the bridge
And you know and you know
'Cause my life's a mess
And I'm trying to grow
So before I'm old I'll confess
You think that I'm strong
You're wrong, you're wrong
I'll sing my song, my song, my song
My bed's full of takeaways
And fantasies of easy lays
The pause button's broke on my video
And is this real cause I feel fake
Oprah Winfrey, Ricki Lake
Teach me things I don't need to know
And you know and you know
'Cause my life's a mess
And it's starting to show
So before I'm old I'll confess
You think that I'm strong
You're wrong, you're wrong
I'll sing my song, my song, my song

I'm still young, we're still young

I was wandering in the rain
Mask of life, feeling insane
Swift and sudden fall from grace
Sunny days seem far away
Kremlin's shadow belittling me
Stalin's tomb won't let me be
On and on and on it came
Wish the rain would just let me
How does it feel (How does it feel?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?
Here abandoned in my fame
Armageddon of the brain
KGB was dogging me
Take my name and just let me be
Then a beggar boy called my name
Happy days will drown the pain
On and on and on it came and again, and again, and again
Take my name and just let me
How does it feel (How does it feel?)

With one light on in one room
I know you're up when I get home
With one small step upon the stair
I know your look when I get there
If you were a king up there on your throne
Would you be wise enough to let me go?
For this queen you think you own
Wants to be a hunter again
I want to see the world alone again
To take a chance on life again
So let me go
The unread book and painful look
The TV's on, the sound is down
One long pause, then you begin
Oh, look what the cat's brought in
If you were a king up there on your throne
Would you be wise enough to let me go?
For this queen you think you own
Wants to be a hunter again
I want to see the world alone again
To take a chance on life again

I believe in love, it's all we got
Love has no boundaries, costs nothin' to touch
War makes money, cancer sleeps
Curled up in my father, and that means somethin' to me
Churches and dictators, politics and papers
Everything crumbles sooner or later
But love
I believe in love
I believe in love, it's all we got
Love has no boundaries, no borders to cross
Love is simple, hate breeds
Those who think difference is the child of disease
Father and son make love and guns
Families together kill someone
Without love
I believe in love
Without love, I wouldn't believe
In anythin' that lives and breathes
Without love, I'd have no anger
I wouldn't believe in the right to stand here
Without love, I wouldn't believe

Che sei diventata la mia lei
Di tutta una vita per me
Ci vuole passione con te
E un briciolo di pazzia
Ci vuole pensiero perciò
Lavoro di fantasia

Fu subito un brivido sì
Ti dico una cosa se non la sai
Per me vale ancora così
Ci vuole passione con te
Non deve mancare mai
Ci vuole mestiere perché
Lavoro di cuore lo sai
Cantare d'amore non basta mai
Ne servirà di più
Per dirtelo ancora per dirti che
Più bella cosa non c'è
Più bella cosa di te
Unica come sei
Immensa quando vuoi
Grazie di esistere
Com'è che non passa con gli anni miei
La voglia infinita di te
Cos'è quel mistero che ancora sei
Che porto qui dentro di me
Saranno i momenti che ho
Quegli attimi che mi dai
Saranno parole però

When do I cry
This breakin' heart
Just hurts me more
When we're apart
And there are two of us
With our secret love
Sleep pretty baby while you wait so long
Livin' with a love that's not just make believe
Lonely nights, I see your candle glow
And in my mind, I trace
Together we can take away

Every little moment we're apart is pain to me
Maybe we can find some hideaway
Everybody knows but who can say
Secretly you know I'd follow
Anywhere to make you happy
Anyway you want me I'll be standing by
I don't wanna lose the one I hunger for
Naked eyes, they watch us everywhere
Nowhere to run, I cry
Everything to lose and no alibi

Uh help me be boy
Just keep giving it to me yeah
I should have known, it seemed too easy
You were there, and I was breathing blue
Strange baby, don't you think I'm looking older?
But something good has happened to me
Change is a stranger you have yet to know
Well, you're out of time, I'm letting go, you'll be fine
Well, that much I know
You're out of time, I'm letting go
I'm not the man you want
I should have known, it seemed so easy
You were there, I thought I needed you
You
Strange baby, don't you think I'm looking older?
But something good has happened to me
Change is a stranger who never seems to show
So you're out of time, I'm letting go, you'll be fine
Or maybe you won't
You're out of time, I'm letting go
I'm not the man that you want
I never should have looked back in your direction
I know that, just the same old fights again, baby
These are wasted days without affection
I'm not that foolish anymore
So you're out of time, I'm letting go, you'll be fine
Well, that much I know
You're out of time, I'm letting go
I'm not the man that you want
Lay it down, pull my heart to the ground
Time's getting cold now the leaves all turn hard and blue
And I know when I gaze to the sun, no place to hide
I got nowhere to run from you, away from you
Hold me now
Girl, I don't know when
When we will ever meet again
That was then
Baby, this is now
I try to get over you
Losing you...
Things will never be the same
Can you hear me call your name?
If we changed it back again
Things would never be...
In your hand
Babe, I don't understand
You've got the eyes of a child
But you hurt like a man
Always do, always do
Touch me now, girl
I don't when
When we will ever meet again
That was then
Baby, this is now
Time won't get over you
Losing you...
Things will never be the same
Can you hear me call your name?
If we changed it back again

Shanice is the one for you to be with
But when I'm caught all alone

Sailing down behind the sun
Waiting for my prince to come
Praying for the healing rain
To restore my soul again
Just a toerag on the run
How did I get here?
What have I done?
When will all my hopes arise?
How will I know him?
When I look in my father's eyes
(Look into my father's eyes)
My father's eyes
When I look in my father's eyes
(Look into my father's eyes)
My father's eyes
Then the light begins to shine
And I hear those ancient lullabies
And as I watch this seedling grow
Feel my heart start to overflow
Where do I find the words to say?
How do I teach him?
What do we play?
Bit by bit, I've realized
That's when I need them
That's when I need my father's eyes
Then the jagged edge appears
Through the distant clouds of tears
I'm like a bridge that was washed away
My foundations were made of clay

Bright light city
You're her religion
Superstars in their own private movie
Play just like children
Lies that take her
Places she's never seen
The kiss and tell of it all
To her it seems so obscene
She's so pretty
Her hair is a mess
We all love her
To that we confess
She has a halo
We really do adore her
For she has a halo
Can we touch her
For their blindness
She sees much further
Like on a wide-screen viewing
Going down on her
She's so pretty
Her hair is a mess
We all love her
To that we confess
She has a halo

You said that love was just a state of mind
A puzzle made of pieces you can't find
And for me you never really had the time, and
I was blind
And everything that you meant to me
Is written in the pages of my history
But it's over now as far as I can see
Suddenly
Things are so different now you're gone
I thought it'd be easy, I was wrong
(And now I'm caught)
And now, I'm caught in the middle
Even though I'm with someone new
All I can think about is you
(And now I'm caught)
And now, I'm caught in the middle
Moving on, she brings me brighter days
Thoughts of you are in my mind always
Like a memory that I can't erase

Kelly took a lifetime searching for the bottom line
I wasn't into searching, 'cause I was doing fine
I wasn't into fighting, chasing, sweating, slaving, fretting, racing
Any waste of effort isn't part of my design
Billy was an inspiration, positive and kind
Until he let confusion overcome his youthful mind
Common sense dictated
I could never be so blind

Happenstance an episode, unplanned alone in time
Coincidence, the second chance re-sounding like a rhyme
How paths may cross against the odds to wreck the plans you made
Among the crowd a face that smiles to melt your masquerade
"If only I could see you", says the stranger deep inside
And lets you know that when you were so sure you really lied
"If only I could see you", says the voice within your brain
And quietly, insistently it says it once again
And then, I really need to know

{PROLOGUE}
Some folks dream of the wonders they'll do
Before their time on this planet is through
Some just don't have anything planned
They hide their hopes and their heads in the sand
Now I don't say who is wrong, who is right
But if by chance you are here for the night
Then all I need is an hour or two
To tell the tale of a dreamer like you
We all dream a lot -- some are lucky, some are not
But if you think it, want it, dream it, then it's real
You are what you feel
But all that I say can be told another way
In the story of a boy whose dreams came true
And he could be you
I closed my eyes, drew back the curtain
To see for certain what I thought I knew
Far far away, someone was weeping
But the world was sleeping
Any dream will do
I wore my coat
With golden lining
Bright colors shining, wonderful and new
And in the east
The dawn was breaking
And the world was waking
Any dream will do
I wore my coat
Aah
 
And in the east
Aah
Aah
A crash of drums, a flash of light
My golden coat flew out of sight
The colors faded into darkness
I was left alone
May I return
To the beginning
The light is dimming
And the dream is too
The world and I
We are still waiting
Still hesitating
Any dream will do
May I return
Aah
Aah
 
The world and I
Aah
Aah
A crash of drums, a flash of light
My golden coat flew out of sight
The colors faded into darkness
I was left alone
May I return
To the beginning
The light is dimming
And the dream is too
The world and I
We are still waiting
Still hesitating
Any dream will do
May I return
Aah
Aah
 
The world and I
Aah
Aah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah. yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We are taking it easy and bright and breezy, yeah
We are livin' it up just fine and dandy, yeah
And it really doesn't matter that we don't eat
And it really doesn't matter if we never sleep
No it really doesn't matter, really doesn't matter at all
Cause we are so young now, we are so young, so young now
And when tomorrow comes we can do it all again
We are chasing the moon just running wild and free
We are following through every dream and every need
And it really doesn't matter if we don't eat
And it really doesn't matter if we never sleep
No it really doesn't matter, really doesn't matter at all
Cause we are so young now, we are so young, so young now
And when tomorrow comes we can do it all again
Yeah we are so young now, we are so young, so young now
And when tomorrow comes, we'll just do it all again
All again, all again, yeah, all again, all again, yeah...
Yeah so young now, we are so, so young now
And when tomorrow comes, we'll just do it all again
Yeah we are so young now, we are so young, so young now
And when tomorrow comes we'll just do it all again
We are so young, yeah, yeah, (repeat till fade)
And in your eyes I see ribbons of color
I see us inside of each other
I feel my unconscious merge with yours
And I hear a voice say, "What's his is hers"
I'm falling into you (falling into you)
This dream could come true
And it feels so good (falling into you)
Falling into you
I was afraid to let you in here
Now I have learned love can't be made in fear
You must begin to tumble down
And I can't even see the ground
I'm falling into you (falling into you)
This dream could come true
And it feels so good (falling into you)
Falling into you
Falling like a leaf, falling like a star
Finding a belief, falling where you are
Catch me, don't let me drop!
Love me, don't ever stop!
So close your eyes and let me kiss you
And while you sleep I will miss you
I'm falling into you (falling into you)

I'm dizzy from the time we spend together
I need that honey drip every hour

Got a feeling for you now that's so strong
I'm dreaming of the candy in your fingertips
Baby don't stay away from me too long
Mmm, mmm, mmm, come on, buzz me up to heaven baby

You make me smile, but you're far away

All the things you do they make me feel so fine
I got to tell the world about a love that's mine (Na, na, na)
These wings to fly are gonna last forever
'Cause one by one my dreams come true
And I touch the sky whenever we're together
I can't believe the joy I get with you

If you put five on dis drop a line on dis, then hit the studio drop a rhyme on dis
Lounging cuz im stable, played the game tight now I'm able, Imagine her drinking
Fuzzy out ya navel, Alcohol sippin till you fall, Now dats what we call a playas ball
Got this on camera, Jump out the ride if you amateur, a damager, Wha Wha
My life is extraordinary bare
I fought the fear and chased the pain
My life doesn't need to be explained
I chose to walk the line as one
Sometimes, as I live upon my island
Cut off from emotion and its pain
Ohhhh, that's when I am tempted by the waters
The waters that can take me far away
So I'll just keep on walking down this open road
Hoping someone somewhere needs me
So I'll just keep on walking down this open road
Talking to the man who knows me
Yes, he knows me
The man is me
My life was once full of people's faces
Brought to me by love which isn't strange
Ohhhh, my life had the goodness of blue waters
A day's a day for all I used to say
Sometimes, I can sit and cry my heart out
Drowning in my autocratic ways
Ohhhh, that's when I am tempted by the waters
The waters that can take me far away
So I'll just keep on walking down this open road
Hoping someone somewhere needs me
So I'll just keep on walking down this open road
Talking to the man who knows me
Yes, he knows me
The man is me
Hm, hm, hm, hm
Hm, hm, hm, hm
My life is now full of people's faces
Within the light of change I pulled away
Ohhhh, my life shows that no man is an island
I've exchanged the piece of life I cut away
Now you won't see me walking down that open road
I've found someone now who needs me
No, you won't see me walking down that open road
I've found at last the man who knows me
Yes, he knows me
And the man was me
The man was me
They tried to catch a falling star
Thinking that she had gone too far
She did but kept it hidden well
Until she cracked and then she fell
If all the history is true
She's gonna end up just like you
You made it to the other side
But tell me who will be my guide
They build you up so they can tear you down
Trust the ocean you'll never drown
Who is next?
Who's gonna steal your crown?
You'll see
I have learnt my lesson well
The truth is out there
I can tell
Don't look back
And don't give in to their lies and goodbyes
Northern Star
Fulfil the longing in your heart
Then we will never be apart
And if they dare to question you
Just tell them that our love is true
They buy your dreams
So they can sell your soul
Is it any wonder we've lost control?
Feelings come, feelings go

My mother came to Hazard when I was just seven
Even then the folks in town said with prejudiced eyes
That boy's not right
Three years ago when I came in on Mary
First time that someone looked beyond the rumors and the lies
Saw the man inside
We used to walk down by the river
She loved to watch the sun go down
We used to walk along the river
And dream our way out of this town
No one understood what I felt for Mary
No one cared until the night she went out walking all alone
And never came home
Man with a badge came knocking next morning
Here was I surrounded by a thousand fingers suddenly
Pointed right at me
I swear I left her by the river
I swear I left her safe and sound
I need to make it to the river
And leave this old Nebraska town
I think about my life gone by
How it's done me wrong
There's no escape for me this time
All of my rescues are gone, long gone
I swear I left her by the river
I swear I left her safe and sound
I need to make it to the river
And leave this old Nebraska town
Wanna cry for you
Would it do any good?
If I rained for you
It would just be water
And the night's with you
And the storm's in your hand
And you're down, and you're down
And I can't lift you
I'm powerless to change your world
I'm powerless to stop the hurt
But I'll give you my heart
Give you my shoulder
I give you my heart
Give you my shoulder
Over and over
Wanna run for you
Would it do any good?
If I flew for you
You would still be standing
And it's hard watching
'Cause I'm part of you
And it's hard not to
Not to know what I can do
I'm powerless to change your world
I'm powerless to stop the hurt
I'm trying hard to be your tower of strength
I'm trying hard to bring you back to joy
I'll give you my heart
Give you my shoulder
I give you my heart
Give you my shoulder

She heard a voice from so far away
It told her her mother had gone away
In the next room down the corridor
Her baby started to cry
Her whole life had just fell apart
There was nothing then the hurting started
In her heavy head on her knees she prayed
Could somebody help her
Clementine
It was never meant to be this way
It was never meant to be this way
Clementine
It was never meant to be this way
It was never meant to be this way
If only I'd told you yesterday
Got in her car and she sped away
Into the floodlit street down by your way
As the sun rose by the morning dew
Well she returned in such a state
Her baby knew not what was going on
But it could tell from her tears that something was wrong with mum
Desperation let out its final scream
But our clementine didn't hear a damn thing
Into the mirror she stared at herself
Asked is that my life is that what I'm here for
Her reflection chose not to respond
As she froze to the spot like a cold hard statue
And bathed in her tears she said her time was through
I was a midnight rider on a cloud of smoke
I could make a woman hang on every single stroke
I was an iron man, I had a master plan
But I was alone
I could hear you breathing with a sigh of the wind
I remember how your body started trembling
Oh, what a night it's been and for the state I'm in
I'm still alone
And all the wonders made for the earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Somehow I always end up alone (always end up alone)
Always end up alone
So I play, I'll wait
Cause you know that love takes time
We came so far
Just the beat of a lonely heart
And it's mine
And I don't want to be alone
Well, since I got no message on your answer phone
Since you're busy every minute I just stay at home
I make believe you care, I feel you everywhere
But I'm still alone
I'm on a wheel of fortune with a twist of fate
Cause I know it isn't heaven, is it love or hate?
Am I the subject of the pain? Am I the stranger in the rain?
I am alone

And I pray it's not too late
We made it so far
Just a beat of a lonely heart
And it's mine
And I don't want to be alone
Gone but not out of sight
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home
Face the heat of the night
The one that you love got a heart that's made of stone
Shine and search for the light
And sooner or later you'll be cruising on your ocean
And clean out of sight
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home
Face the heat of the night
The one that you love got a heart that's made of stone
Shine and search for the light
And sooner or later you'll be cruising on your ocean
And clean out of sight
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
I feel good, I feel nice
I've never felt so satisfied
I'm in love, I'm alive
Intoxicated, flying high
It feels like a dream
When you touch me tenderly
I don't know if it's real
But I like the way I feel inside
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
In the morning when I rise
You are the first thing on my mind
And in the middle of the night
I feel your heartbeat next to mine
It feels like a dream
When you love me tenderly
I don't know if you're for real

It's the sign of the times, girl
Sad songs on the radio
It's the sign of the times, girl
As the leaves begin to go
But all these signs now
Showing on my face
Proving me wrong, taking it's place
And I pray to God
That there's more that we can do, yeah
And I pray to God
That there's more that we can show
More that we can do, yeah
Isn't It a Wonder
As a newborn baby cries
And isn't it a wonder
With the sweetness in my eyes
And isn't it a wonder
At the crossroads of my life
Isn't it a wonder?
Isn't it a wonder, to me?
It's the way of the world when
Wrong takes hold of right
It's the way of the world
In which we've all lost sight
But isn't this world
Too simple to be true?
Holding on to memories of you
And I pray to God
That there's more that we can do, yeah
And I pray to God
That there's more that we can show
More that we can do, yeah

But I won't look back
Cos that's behind me
And after all
Strong words are spoken
My heart will never be, never be
Never be broken...
My Papa told me to stay out of trouble
When you've found your man
Make sure he's for real
I've learnt that nothing really lasts for ever
I sleep with the scars
I wear that won't heal
They won't heal
'Cause every time I seem to fall in love
Crash! Boom! Bang!
I find the heart but then I hit the wall
Crash! Boom! Bang!
That's the call, that's the game
And the pain stays the same
I'm walking down this empty road to nowhere
I pass by the houses and blocks I once knew
My mama told me not to mess with sorrow
But I always did, and Lord, I still do
I'm still breaking the rule
I kick it up, I kick it down!
'Cause every time I seem to fall in love
Crash! Boom! Bang!
I find the heart but then I hit the wall
Crash! Boom! Bang!
That's my real middle name
It has always been the same
That's the call, that's the game
And the pain stays the same
I still feel the heat
Slowly fallin' (from the sky)
And the taste of the kissing
Shattered by rain
(Comin' tumblin') from behind
And the wild holy war
I kick it up, I kick it down!

I need a lover to give me
The kind of love that will last always
I need somebody uplifting
To take me away, baby
I want a lover who knows me
Who understands how I feel inside
Someone to comfort and hold me
Through the long lonely nights
'Till the dawn
Why don't you take me away?
Dreamlover, come rescue me
Take me up, take me down
Take me anywhere you want to, baby, now
I need you so desperately
Won't you please come around?
'Cause I wanna share forever with you, baby
I don't want another pretender
To disillusion me one more time
Whispering words of forever
Playing with my mind
(No no no, no no, baby)
I need someone to hold on to
The kind of love that won't fly away
I just want someone to belong to
Every day
Of my life
Always

Lips that promise, fear the worst
Tongue so sharp, the bubble burst
Just into unjust...
I've had a little time to find the truth
Now I've had a little room to check what's wrong
I've had a little time, and I still love you
I've had a little...
You had a little time and you had a little fun
Didn't ya, didn't you?

Is yours for good, I hope you're glad

Dream of the good times
That we never knew
No late nights alone in your arms
I'll dream on
Living in wonder
Thinking of you
Still looking for ways to uncover the truth
You're so young is all they can say
They don't know
If I could change the way of the world
I'd be your girl
Too many walls
Have been built in between us
Too many dreams
Have been shattered around us
If I seem to give up
They'll still never win
Deep in my heart
I know the strength is within
Watching the others
Chances drift by
They'll never discover these feelings I hide
Deep inside
I'm falling apart
All alone with a broken heart
Thinking in silence
Is all they allow
These words still unspoken may never be found

As I walk this land of broken dreams
I have visions of many things
Happiness is just an illusion
Filled with sadness and confusion
What becomes of the brokenhearted?
Who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Help me please
The roots of love grow all around
But for me they come tumbling down
Everyday heartaches grow a little stronger
I can't stand this pain much longer
I walk in shadows
Searching for light
Going it alone
No comfort in sight
Hoping and praying
For someone who cares
Always moving But going nowhere
I'm searching though
I don't succeed, no
For someone's love
There's a growing need
All is lost
There's no place for beginning
All that's left is an unhappy ending

You've got that look again
The one I hoped I had when I was a lad
Your face is just beaming
Your smile got me boasting, my pulse roller-coastering
Anyway the four winds that blow
They're gonna send me sailing home to you
Or I'll fly with the force of a rainbow
The dream of gold will be waiting me in your eyes
You know I'd do most anything you want
Hey I, I try to give you everything you need
I can see that it gets to you
I don't believe in many things
But in you I do
Her faith is amazing
The pain that she goes through
Contained in the hope for you
Your whole world has changed
The years spent before seem more cloudy than blue
In many ways your baby's controlling
When you haven't laid down for days
For the poor no time to be thinking
They're too busy finding ways
You know I'd do most anything you want
Hey I, I try to give you everything you need
I'll see that it gets to you

I don't believe in many things
But in you I do
I'll be the one
I guess you were lost when I met you
Still there were tears in your eyes
So out of trust and I knew
No more than mysteries and lies
There you are, wild and free
Reaching out like you needed me
A helping hand to make it right
I am holding you all through the night
I'll be the one (I'll be the one)
Who will make all your sorrows undone
I'll be the light (I'll be the light)
When you feel like there's nowhere to run
I'll be the one

See you in my dreams -dreams-
Got me spinning round and round
Turning upside down
But I only hear you breathe
In bed I lie
No need to cry
My sleeping cry
Hawaiian high
But its only when I sleep
Got me spinning round and round
Turning upside down
Up to the sky
Where angels fly
I'll never die
Hawaiian high
But its only when I sleep
Got me spinning round and round
Turning upside down
There was a time I was everything and nothin' all in one
When you found me, I was feelin' like a cloud across the sun
Well, I need to tell ya how you light up every second of the day
But in the moonlight, you just shine like a beacon on the bay
And I can't explain
But it's somethin' about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
It's that feelin' I get about you deep inside
And I can't describe
But it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
The way you look tonight
With a smile, you pull the deepest secrets from my heart
In all honesty, I'm speechless, and I don't know where to start
And I can't explain
But it's somethin' about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
It's that feelin' I get about you deep inside
And I can't describe
But it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
The way you look tonight
And I can't explain
But it's somethin' about the way you look tonight
Oh, takes my breath away
It's that feelin' I get about you deep inside
And I can't describe
But it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight

The way you look tonight

(The way you look) Way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
It felt like springtime
On this February morning
In a courtyard
Birds were singing your praise
I'm still recalling things you said
To make me feel all right
I carry them with me today now
As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name
Into the sky
And I will wake up happy
I wonder why
I feel so high
Though I am not above the sorrow
Heavy-hearted
'Til you call my name
And it sounds like church bells
Or the whistle of a train
On a summer evening
I want to meet you barefoot
Barely breathing
As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)
And I will wake up happy
Oh, darling
As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)
And I will wake up happy
You might also like
It's not too near for me
Like a flower I need the rain
Though it's not clear to me
Every season has its change
And I will see you
When the sun comes out again
As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)
And I will wake up happy
As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)
And I will wake up happy
I wonder why (ooh la kah koh)
Mmm, the sun comes out again (ooh la kah koh)
When the sun comes out again
When the sun comes out again
When the sun comes out
Oh, the sun comes out again
When the sun comes out
(Ooh) Oh-oh
(Ooh) Yeah yeah
Na na na na na na na

What is love? 'Cause baby, I don't know
I got a funny feeling in my heart
If this is love, it feels like butterflies
So tell me, baby, is this how it starts?
I know I've never felt like this before
You're like a drug, you got me wanting more
I've got to let you know

She used to be my only enemy and never let me be free
Catching me in places that I knew I shouldn't be
Every other day I crossed the line, I didn't mean to be so bad
I never thought you would become the friend I never had
Back then I didn't know why
Why you were misunderstood (Mama)
So now I see through your eyes
All that you did was love
Mama I love you, Mama I care
Mama I love you, Mama my friend
You're my friend
I didn't want to hear it then, but I'm not ashamed to say it now
Every little thing you said and did was right for me
I've had a lot of time to think about, about the way I used to be
Never had a sense of my responsibility
Back then I didn't know why
Why you were misunderstood
So now I see through your eyes
All that you did was love

I saw you dancin' out the ocean
Runnin' fast along the sand
A spirit born of earth and water
Fire flyin' from your hands
In the instant that you love someone
In the second that the hammer hits
Reality runs up your spine
And the pieces finally fit
And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields, where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Baby, you're the one
There are caravans we follow
Drunken nights in dark hotels
When chances breathe between the silence
Where sex and love no longer gel, oh
For each man, in his time, is Cain
Until he walks along the beach
And sees his future in the water
A long, lost heart within his reach
And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields, where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Ooh, baby, you're the one
And all I ever needed was the one

My tears will soon be over
With your conscience clear for a new life ahead
Don't be sorry, I really need to hear the truth
But the only thing I'm asking, cause I need you to
Remember me, as the only one who set you free
Maybe time alone will make you see
How deep our love could be
No, it's never too late
Cause I know, this isn't the first time
It won't be the last time
I surrender my soul
Cause you're always, keepin' me waitin', anticipatin'
The day we find love once again
I won't give up while there's a glimmer of a chance
A dream that's never ending
Inviting love and a perfect romance
A burning passion, oh baby you're my destiny
But the message I'm receivein', is your through with me
But I'll be there, even though you tell me you don't care
How could you forget the times we've shared
Don't throw our love away, you know it's never too late

To start a new day
Out there the world is waiting
To take us far away
And it's time to make
The final break
But the memory will linger forever
If I never see you again
And think of me now and then
Though it hurts so sweetly
They say all good things come to an end
You've changed my life completely
I'm touched by your love
Even if I never see you again
The night is so unforgiving, yeah
And I'm on my own
I realise what I'm missing
And now that you've gone
So I say a prayer
Are you out there
Are you feeling what I'm feeling now, yeah

Every time I think of you, I always catch my breath
And I'm still standing here, and you're miles away
And I'm wondering why you left
And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight
I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile
I spend my time thinking about you
And it's almost driving me wild
And there's a heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight
I ain't missing you at all (missing you)
Since you've been gone away (missing you)
I ain't missing you (missing you)
No matter what I might say (missing you)
There's a message in the wire
And I'm sending the signal tonight
You don't know how desperate I've become
And it looks like I'm losing this fight
In your world I have no meaning
Though I'm trying hard to understand
And it's my heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight
I ain't missing you at all (missing you)
Since you've been gone away (missing you)
I ain't missing you (missing you)
No matter what I might say (missing you)
There's a message that I'm sending out
Via telegraph to your soul

Love, it has so many beautiful faces
Sharing lives and sharing days
My love it had so many empty spaces
I'm sharing a memory now
I hope that's how it stays
Now I'm deep inside love and still breathing
She is holding my heart in her hand
I'm the closest I've been to believing
This could be love forever
All throughout my life
The reasons I've demanded
But how can I reason
With the reason I'm a man
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh yeah
Hmm
In a minute I'm needing to hold her
In an hour I'm cold, cold as stone
When she leaves it gets harder and harder
To face life alone
Now my dreams are filled
With times when we're together
Guess what I need from her
Is forever love
Ooh, Ooh, yeah

But the bolt reminds me I was there
So give me strength
To face this test tonight
If only I could turn back time
If only I had said what I still hide
If only I could turn back time

Wish for you on a falling star, wondering where you are
Do I ever cross your mind in the warm sunshine?
She's from the City of Angels like Betty Davis, James Dean, and Gable
Never know what she means to me, I fell for the girl that's on TV
Met her at a counter affair
She wore a green dress and everybody was there
Felt out of place
Till she looked into my eyes
Shook your hand around 9 p.m
And I'm never gonna be the same again
Never had to be on a movie screen
To be the leading lady in all my dreams
Shooby-doo-wop and Scooby Snacks, met a fly girl and I can't relax
The only problem is she's a movie star, oh
My friends, they won't believe me if they could only see me
At the risk of soundin' cheesy, I think I fell for the girl on TV

But short term solution ain't no resolution
That ain't no release for me
Too much of something is bad enough
But something's coming over me to make me wonder
Too much of nothing is just as tough
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied
Unwrap yourself from around my finger
Hold me too tight or left to linger
Something fine built to last
Slipped up there, I guess we're running out of time too fast
Yes my dear you know he soothes me (moves me)
There's no complication, there's no explanation

With all the static in my head

Here we go again, thru the backstreets of my mind
It seems my life was standing still
Who's sorry now, it's funny how I didn't know it
Here we go again, fighting things we never win
It seems our love was standing still I'm sorry now
It's funny how I don't feel the love
I just hear the words, Julia says
She doesn't know what it's all about
She doesn't seem to care at all
Open your eyes and see
Love hurts

It's not time to make a change
Just relax, take it easy
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to know
Find a girl, settle down
If you want you can marry
Look at me, I am old
But I'm happy
I was once like you are now
And I know that it's not easy
To be calm when you've found
Something going on
But take your time, think a lot
Think of everything you've got
For you will still be here tomorrow
But your dreams may not
How can I try to explain?
When I do, it turns away again
And it's always been the same, same old story
From the moment I could talk
I was ordered to listen
Now there's a way
And I know that I have to go away
I know I have to go
It's not time to make a change
Just sit down and take it slowly
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to go through
Find a girl, settle down
If you want you can marry
Look at me, I am old
But I'm happy

When darkness is upon your door

If you need to crash, then crash and burn, you're not alone

Would I declare to you, your love takes me higher

Will it still feel the same?
How many times have I tried
To turn this love around?
I don't wanna give up but, baby
It's time I had two feet on the ground
Can you release me?
Can you release me?
Now that you're gone
I can't help myself from wondering
Ohh, if you'd have come down from your high
Would we've been all right?
Release me
Can you release me?
Come on, baby, come on, baby
You knew it was time to just let go

You knew it was time to just let go
'Cause we wanna be free
Somehow it's just not that easy
Oh, oh, oh, baby
Come on darlin', now, hear me darlin'
'Cause you're a waste of time for me
I'm trying to make you see
That baby, you've just got to release me
Now tell me
What is this power you've got on me?
What is this power? Ohh
Come on, baby, come on, baby

That baby, you've just got to release me
Release me, release me
Release me, will you release me?
Ahh, release me
Release me, will you release me?
When I need you
I just close my eyes and I'm with you
And all that I so want to give you
It's only a heart beat away
When I need love
I hold out my hands and I touch love
I never knew there was so much love
Keeping me warm night and day
Miles and miles of empty space in between us
A telephone can't take the place of your smile
Oh, but you know I won't be traveling for ever
It's cold out, but hold out and do like I do
When I need you
I just close my eyes and I'm with you
And all that I so want to give you baby
It's only a heart beat away
It's not easy when the road is your driver
Honey, that's a heavy load that we bear
But you know I won't be traveling a lifetime
It's cold out but hold out and do like I do
When I need love
I hold out my hands and I touch love
I never knew oh never knew there was so much love
Keeping me warm night and day
Oh
When I need you
I just close my eyes and I'm with you (I just close my eyes)
And all that I so want to give you baby
It's only a heart beat away
When I need you (When I need)
I just close my eyes and I'm with you
And all that I so want to give you baby (When I need)
It's only a heart beat away (It's only a heart beat away)
When I need you
I just close my eyes and I'm with you
I know that when you look at me
There's so much that you just don't see
But if you would only take the time
I know in my heart you'd find
Oh, a girl who's scared sometimes
Who isn't always strong
Can't you see the hurt in me?
I feel so all alone
I wanna run to you
I wanna run to you
Won't you hold me in your arms
And keep me safe from harm?
I wanna run to you
But if I come to you
Tell me, will you stay
Or will you run away?
Each day, each day I play the role
Of someone always in control
But at night, I come home and turn the key
There's nobody there, no one cares for me
Oh, what's the sense
Of trying hard to find your dreams
Without someone to share it with?
Tell me, what does it mean?
I wanna run to you
I wanna run to you
Won't you hold me in your arms
And keep me safe from harm?
I wanna run to you
But if I come to you
Tell me, will you stay
Or will you run away?
Run away
I need you here
I need you here to wipe away my tears
To kiss away my fears, no
If you only knew
How much

And as I look into your eyes
I see an angel in disguise
Sent from God above for me to love
To hold and idolize
And as I hold your body near
I'll see this month through to a year
And then forever on till life is gone
I'll keep your loving near
And now I've finally found my way
To lead me down this lonely road
All I have to do is follow you
To lighten off my load
You treat me like a rose
You give me room to grow
You shone the light of love on me
And gave me air so I can breathe
You open doors that close
In a world where anything goes
You give me strength so I stand tall
Within this bed of earth
Just like a rose
And when I feel like hope is gone
You give me strength to carry on
Each time I look at you there's something new
To keep our loving strong
I hear you whisper in my ear
All of the words I long to hear
Of how you'll always be here next to me
To wipe away my tears
And now I've finally found my way
To lead me down this lonely road

Within this bed of earth
Just like a rose
And though the seasons change
Our love remains the same
(Just like a rose)
You face the thunder
When the sunshine turns to rain
(Just like a rose)
You treat me like a rose (You treat me like a rose)
You give me room to grow (You give me room to grow)
You shone the light of love on me

Whoa, like a rose (Just like a rose)
No, oh (ah)
You treat me like a rose (Just like a rose)
No no no no oh (ah ah ah ah)
You give me strength so I stand tall
Within this bed of earth
Just like a rose
I have often dreamed, of a far-off place
Where a hero's welcome, would be waiting for me
Where the crowds will cheer, when they see my face
And a voice keeps saying, "This is where I'm meant to be."
I'll be there someday, I can go the distance
I will find my way, if I can be strong
I know every mile, will be worth my while
When I go the distance, I'll be right where I belong
Down an unknown road, to embrace my fate
Though the road may wander, it will lead me to you
And a thousand years, would be worth the wait
It may take a lifetime, but somehow I'll see it through
And I won't look back, I can go the distance
And I'll stay on track, no I won't accept defeat
It's an uphill slope, but I won't lose hope
Till I go the distance and my journey is complete
But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part
For a hero's strength is measured by his heart
Like a shooting star, I will go the distance
I will search the world, I will face its harms
I don't care how far, I can go the distance
Till I find my hero's welcome, waiting in your arms
I will search the world, I will face its harms
Till I find my hero's welcome, waiting in your arms
Rescue me from the mire
Whisper words of desire
Rescue me - darling, rescue me
With your arms open wide
Want you here by my side
Come to me - darling, rescue me
When this world's closing in
There's no need to pretend
Set me free - darling, rescue me
I don't wanna let you go
So I'm standing in your way
I never needed anyone like I'm needing you today
Do I have to say the words?
Do I have to tell the truth?
Do I have to shout it out?
Do I have to say a prayer?
Must I prove to you how good we are together?
Do I have to say the words?
Rescue me from despair
Tell me you will be there
Help me please - darling, rescue me
Every dream that we share
Every cross that we bear
Can't you see - darling, rescue me
Used to be that I believed in something
Used to be that I believed in love
It's been a long time since I've had that feeling
I could love someone, I could trust someone
I said I'd never let nobody near my heart again, darlin'
I said I'd never let nobody in
But if you asked me to
I just might change my mind
And let you in my life forever
If you asked me to
I just might give my heart
And stay here in your arms forever
If you asked me to
If you asked me to
Somehow ever since I've been around you
Can't go back to being on my own
Can't help feeling, darlin', since I've found you
That I've found my home, that I'm finally home
I said I'd never let nobody get too close to me, darlin'
I said I needed, needed to be free
But if you asked me to
I just might change my mind
And let you in my life forever
If you asked me to
I just might give my heart
And stay here in your arms forever
If you asked me to
If you
Asked me to, I will give my world to you, baby
I need you now (I need you now)
Asked me to, and I'll do anything (anything) for you, baby

Everything, everything, baby!
(If you asked me to)
I couldn't ask what you do to me
If you asked me to
(If you asked me to)
(Oooh-yeah)
I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you (anything)
Anything you want me to
Oooh-ooh-oooh-ooh-ooh
(Oooh-ooh-ooh-oooh) Hey baby
I'd walk halfway around the world
For just one kiss from you
Far beyond the call of love
The sun, the stars, the moon
As long as your love's there to lead me
I won't lose my way, believe me
Even through the darkest night, you know
I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
Your love as far as I can see
Is all I'm ever gonna need
There's one thing for sure
I know it's true (I know it's true)
Baby, I'd go anywhere for you (for you)
I used to think that dreams were just
For sentimental fools
And I'd never find someone
Who'd give their love so true
But I knew the very minute
Couldn't live my life without you in it
And now I want the whole wide world
To know
I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
Your love as far as I can see (see yeah)
Is all I'm ever gonna need

You took your coat off and stood in the rain
You're always crazy like that
And I watched from my window
Always felt I was outside looking in on you
You're always the mysterious one with
Dark eyes and careless hair
You were fashionably sensitive, but too cool to care
You stood in my doorway, with nothing to say
Besides some comment on the weather
Well, in case you failed to notice
In case you failed to see
This is my heart bleeding before you
This is me down on my knees
These foolish games are tearing me apart
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart
You're always brilliant in the morning
Smoking your cigarettes, and talking over coffee
Your philosophies on art, Baroque moved you
You loved Mozart, and you'd speak of your loved ones
As I clumsily strummed my guitar
You'd teach me of honest things
Things that were daring, things that were clean
Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean
I hid my soiled hands behind my back
Somewhere along the line, I must've gone off track with you
Excuse me
Think I've mistaken you for somebody else
Somebody who gave a damn
Somebody more like myself

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
You are the candle, love's the flame
A fire that burns through wind and rain
Shine your light on this heart of mine
'Til the end of time
You came to me like the dawn through the night
Just shinin' like the sun
Out of my dreams and into my life
You are the one, you are the one
Said I loved you but I lied
'Cause this is more than love I feel inside
Said I loved you but I was wrong
'Cause love could never ever feel so strong
Said I loved you but I lied
With all my soul, I've tried in vain
How can mere words my heart explain?
This taste of heaven, so deep, so true
I've found in you
So many reasons in so many ways
My life has just begun
Need you forever, I need you to stay
You are the one, you are the one

Good-looking, bad-tasting
Full-bodied, butt wasting
Loose living, tight-fitting
What you see ain't what you are getting
Big make-up, little break-up
She wants it, he's got it
Cold-blooded, hot gossip

Face is free
Maybe next time, use your eyes and
Look at me
I'm a drama queen if that's your
Thing, baby

Ah-ah-ah-ah
Fake honey, real plastic
Stupid cupid, fantastic
Queer thinking, straight talking

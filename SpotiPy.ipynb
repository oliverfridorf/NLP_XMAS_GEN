wanna work\\nIt ain\\'t nuttin\\' to get him a Cardiff job\\nMan decamp dingers, dodge them tickets\\nThe obbo is real, we cut from cops\\nUnlimited shells for all of my opps\\nMy darg got me so he\\'s barking it off\\nMan dance with smoke in the function\\nIon know nothing about parking it off\\nYoung boy wanna work\\nIt ain\\'t nuttin\\' to get him a Cardiff job\\nMan decamp dingers, dodge them tickets\\nThe obbo is real, we cut from cops\\nUnlimited shells-\\n\\n[Verse 4: KO]\\nWe go on a step, ain\\'t nothin\\' selective, pull up and crash\\nThey lack, ain\\'t holding no leggings with cheffings\\nSo they best pull up their pants\\nThey bang it could\\'ve been blanks\\nWe bang it could\\'ve been banks\\nFill up the tank, pull up with gang\\nPull up no joking, pulling no prank\\nFree my bros all locked\\nI\\'m sending them quids, not stamps\\nThey bucking to opps, still settin\\' it\\nGivin\\' them fist and stamps\\nThey running away, we hoping that them boys trip or cramp\\nNone of that relevance or hit that can\\nYo, we already know pigs on gang\\nRun up in my residence, grip my hands\\nDo dirt definite, things get planned\\n[?] intelligence if we get bagged\\n[?] snitched and sang\\n\\nPart 4\\n\\n[Verse 1: KO]\\nI\\'m tired of giving them chase\\nSeen man hella times in a week\\nEvery sight he\\'s done skeet, bet he\\'s tired of seein\\' my face\\nI line up a sword and get busy\\nLeave a pool like Shaun if I ride and I rise that gauge\\nWhen it comes to street\\nThis corn ain\\'t sweet, if you eat, end up in a maze\\nIf we got beef, cut through my estate\\nAnd you might end up in a state\\nI want my G\\'s free like I rob guns\\nBut I mean my peeps locked down behind gates\\nIf man lack and we pop down\\nMight jump man, we ain\\'t slidin\\' with Drake\\nWaps for sale, price too high\\nIf we do buy, step out tryna make man shake\\nBro\\'s in jail cah they whip flake\\nPebbled it down, do the same with beige\\nAnd gang\\'s in jail cah they risk take\\nPeddled it round, make wounds with blades\\nLife on the road for my dargs ain\\'t straight\\nStill bark, don\\'t get it twist like braids\\nYoung boys, if you\\'re doing it bait, you don\\'t have to, no\\n\\n[Verse 2: Jimmy]\\nI stick with my bros like Mario and Luigi\\nBroski pointed that finger like ET\\nThen the ride spun like CD\\nMore time, I work times three like RiRi\\nI just got a text and it says \\'come see me\\'\\nAnd nah, I ain\\'t linky\\nThat\\'s green cah seaweed\\nBare chat \\'pon PC\\nWild birds fly like Armani\\nCome like I\\'m glued to my car seat\\nMy eyes stay peeled for them \\'rales\\nThey ain\\'t playin\\' no games like Serani\\nOut here\\'s pepper, that\\'s chilli con carne\\nJust shot a Nina for a fifteen\\nShit nah, Jimmy\\'s bein\\' naughty\\nDon\\'t show the gyally dem too much\\nCah the gyally dem talky\\nPlus, most of them naughty\\nWouldn\\'t put it past but you probably wouldn\\'t either\\nThe gang got bad boys anywhere\\nYou can feel the aura like Rita\\nMost likely do a drill, grab some trees then go bang FIFA\\nI\\'ve been servin\\' shots, no tequila\\nAnd bro ain\\'t dealin\\' with cards\\nBut he serves, he\\'s a dealer\\nBad ting wan\\' grip on the wand like Sabrina\\nPlus she want smoke like Khalifa\\nI\\'m cuttin\\' tru\\' the Nina\\nHit that sale then hasta la vista\\nI grab the weight, make a call, that\\'s instant cash\\nI could bruck it down\\nThat\\'s hands on pans and a couple bands\\nI could dial in bro\\nI need a lick, so line man that\\nYou know I got heart like and Irishman\\nSplit that in two, we dividin\\' that\\nAnd bro-bro gets it off the run ups\\nJust run up and headlock a China man\\n[?] grub down when it\\'s dryin\\' akh\\nAnd- is a well known driver\\nNah, he ain\\'t no taxi man\\nHe\\'s black from head to toe\\nBut he ain\\'t no taxi man\\nGot eight man stuffed in the wagon\\nAll on volts to hop out on man\\nBro might slap with one eye\\nBut he ain\\'t got sharingan\\nSee a blast from the palm like Iron Man\\nThey think they\\'re bad\\nJumpin\\' out prams like eggs in a fryin\\' pan\\n[?] like Jackie Chan\\nRun out of zips, where\\'s the plastic bags?\\nWish me well cah I love the grind\\nJimmy come far from a handicap\\nJust banged a left on the Transit van\\nBare angle like I\\'m doin\\' maths\\nThose are opps, that\\'s a flight with gang\\nOr I fly it on solo\\nTake it out, bounce back like a pogo\\nThen I come back, dish out pics, no photos\\n\\n[Verse 3: KO]\\nAll we\\'s tryna do is take them away\\nOn road, get shot, or in jail, get boxed\\nIf you\\'re in the vids like Haye\\nWhen arms get raised, go step\\nTry put him in pics if [?]\\nHair stain for Rolex\\nGimme a date, gimme a date\\nWe\\'ll take it away, ay, ay\\nKids like drinks\\nIf they don\\'t want it straight then we give \\'em a chase\\nPut the team on strip with things\\nUsed to walk \\'round \\'til my feet start ache\\nAin\\'t nuttin\\', you got played by a girl\\nChing in the chest, you will see heartbreak\\nNo money, you gon\\' suffer in this world\\nGet bread and be vex, better man start save\\nOut lookin\\' for a K or Dayto bro\\nTell yours \\'roll safe\\'\\nWe flavourless, it can\\'t blaze\\n[?] correct, get taken away\\nReall tryna beat those sweets\\nThe teeth so long might start to decay\\nLike his wage went up, we\\'ll get him a raise\\n\\nPart 5\\n\\n[Verse 1: Al Chubbino]\\nHave you ever been down a flat\\nAnd had to bounce back off a ounce of crack\\nBounce back off a two and a Q\\nFour and a half, I don\\'t think you know the half\\nNuttin\\' ain\\'t funny, throught this pain I laugh\\nI can never be bummy, throught the rain I graft\\nI used to walk home in damp down jumpers\\nStarted seein\\' runners, they ain\\'t even in London\\nLife changed when I whipped up somethin\\'\\nWent from a half box to a half onion\\nBought a little somethin\\' for when I got functions\\nCan\\'t believe I could get drawn out for\\nTen years deep, I ain\\'t beefin\\' with youngers\\nLittle bro\\'s saucy, the hood\\'s full of dumpers\\nI don\\'t mind war but peri like Columbus\\nI don\\'t wanna be skippin\\' any summers\\nHow many phones have I picked up?\\nBowls that I whipped up\\nStraight came back, same shape as the bowl\\nNuttin\\' chipped up\\nRemember when I took that L\\nThat\\'s the last time I left these wraps with a fat girl\\nBad winters, cold summers\\nI was OT with no runners\\n\\n[Verse 2: Jimmy]\\nLook, you already know the name\\nI\\'m MP, no Theresa May\\nMaximum profit when I grab the weight\\nMy young boy got stuck, I had to pave the way\\nBest save that cake for the rainy days\\nThe mash shoot, it got bass like 808\\nMy boy don\\'t slip in the bin, he got his razor blade\\nCah he trapped in the box like David Blaine\\nMy guy wants a box but he ain\\'t David Haye\\nHis plug was takin\\' long so I made his day\\nNeed a link for the bricks but I ain\\'t talkin\\' slate\\nIf they do me wrong, I\\'ma do the race\\nWe\\'ll make man drown the sailor way\\nYou know I\\'m from, when we sight, there\\'s no delay\\nHold a chase when man back it and dash afraid\\nThen bake off, roll a paper plane\\nHave you ever been flat on your face, crazy\\nHittin\\' stains with a plan to escape\\nLook, I started from a quarter and I pushed a two and a daughter\\nI was juggin\\' out a block, it was hot like a sauna\\nFrom a four and a half to a half a box\\nI bop with this thing, I don\\'t rely on luck\\nI turned dark like I\\'m closin\\' the curtains\\nIf trouble pops up, we just call for them burners\\n\\n[Verse 3: Stally]\\nMoney\\'s what I\\'m needin\\'\\nSo I\\'m out here tryna get it\\nStuffin\\' shells in this dotty\\nSlap it, fill \\'em up with pellets\\nSticky when I press it\\nOn these streets of Hackney\\nYeah, I\\'m known as a menace\\nBut nuttin\\' like Dennis\\nBut I\\'m clinical like Bergkamp\\nComfy when I burst that\\nComfy when I\\'m pressin\\'\\nMan can\\'t tell me \\'bout steppin\\'\\nGave that gyal dick\\nI gave that gyal a good session\\nBring it to the owner like you\\'re returning possession\\n\\'Cause I\\'m a t\\'ug on road like I\\'m a t\\'ug in jail\\nCrash corn on your block, I\\'m really tryna cause hell\\nAnd then I bake off with a sweet one\\nShe makes the food, burn my clothes from the drill\\nYeah, she a real one\\nPeople cryin\\', hoods flyin\\', lift up boy\\nHelp you pull the suttin\\' out the nose of the stub boy\\n[?] we official\\nI ain\\'t lyin\\', we make \\'nuff\\nCop sticks and stay dumpin\\' on these fuckboys\\n\\n[Verse 4: Billy Billions]\\nEvery single member of my team is a boss\\nStructure in a gang so I ain\\'t worried \\'bout a loss\\nIf I send a hit, you\\'ll see the light like a moth\\nI sell the re-up raw and then I\\'m steppin\\' on a prof\\'\\nDabbin\\' with the devil, you can tell it\\'s high stakes\\nWorkers got a worker, they ain\\'t makin\\' no mistakes\\nWhen I\\'m in a kitchen, I ain\\'t cookin\\' up a steak\\n[?] we got dinner here for days\\n[?]\\nWith my missus in the shard when I\\'m re-ing up on flake\\nGot yourself a slice but you ain\\'t never bought a cake\\nIn the trap, they call me Mr Thirty Six Shapes\\nWeather them storms, most said I couldn\\'t heart it\\nFelt like Leonidas before the king departed\\nOn a T max like a chariot chargin\\'\\nIf I weren\\'t trappin\\' and drillin\\', I\\'d be chartin\\'\\n\\n[Verse 5: Kilo Keemzo]\\nThey locked my brother Trappo, still he be missin\\'\\nI told him \\'roll easy\\' but he didn\\'t listen\\nMum

calls, \\'Keemz, are you listenin\\'?\\'\\nHe ain\\'t seen his siblings\\nNephews ain\\'t seein\\' the christening\\nThey wanna know when\\'s the next song\\nBut it gets long, feels like I\\'m slept on\\nThey say \\'015, I should\\'ve kept on\\nUh, but let me tell you where it went wrong\\nCah \\'008, that\\'s the year they took Fes don\\nAnd it\\'s \\'19 and bro\\'s still tryna get one\\nRedrum, we ain\\'t tryna stay \\'til the fed come\\nCah that\\'s another case\\nThey got my nigga doin\\' basic bang up\\nCah the judge gave time when he raised his hammer\\nOne eye, I can hear satan chatter\\nBut this next ear\\'s tellin\\' me to sway the passa\\nMy bro taught a teen, he\\'s just trainin\\' trappers\\nPut him on the train, don\\'t delay the package\\nMy nephews don\\'t walk the lane that man did\\nI do this for the niece like my name was Patrick\\nSame time, I do this for the gang\\nMy bro doin\\' six time four in the can\\nSo you do the maths\\nMummy said we were movin\\' stupid and fact\\nIn old school days, cats swoopin\\' on chats\\nShout Chezrita, she\\'s smooth with them plaits\\nI ain\\'t glued to the flats\\nOne phone call, hear my goon, he\\'s attacked\\nI

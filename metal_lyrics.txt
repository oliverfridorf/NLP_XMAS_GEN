Beyond the walls where waves collide
There's a fire burning,
Burning with perfection 'neath the flesh
Inside the halls, my mind declines
There's an illusion failing,
But she's trying hard to shape my way (of thinking)

She's the one who built this prison I'm the one who broke inside
And against myself, I made my stand
Then I tried to cross the waters to become invisible
And without my flesh, I lost the way

Beyond the bridge, a distant cloud
There's a noise so silent
Hearing nothing can be loud as well
In the end, I see the waters
There's a light, it's shining!
But I am afraid that now it's too late

She's the one who built this prison I'm the one who broke inside
And against myself, I made my stand
Then I tried to cross the waters to become invisible
And without my flesh, I lost the way

Time, you see, is slipping away undoing a wall of sand, come...
Time, you feel, is releasing the self your trip is about to start, come...
Some memories fade and so does my soul
#CLAES#
With (my) mind unclouded I pierce the light
With a broken heart, I welcome darkness
With soul enslaved and feathered hand
I become the path without beginning nor end

You let this sickness grow inside
One seed that makes a forest
And embraced the night in the death of the day

I reach the crest of light. I reach the crest of pain
I died and watched it flow, the body... futile
Mysterious devotion just to set our own destruction
(But) the mask I wear was mine

I am a child of Earth and starry Sky
Tell the gods here I am: the Bacchic One
I'll descend and walk through this decay
And with an Orphic voice I'll unravel my illusions

I reach the crest of light. I reach the crest of pain
I died and watched it flow, the body... futile
Mysterious devotion just to set our own destruction
(But) the mask I wear was mine

The mask I wear was mine
Esa máscara es mía
Masken jag bär var min
#CLAES#
Where do I belong? When do I belong?
Maybe the silence will remain
In my constant soul, as an unwanted friend
The flesh has to fall and the vessel has to rot
Pushing this life to a written end
To the Orphic void, resetting time

I made up my mind, this will be my last
Even if it leads nowhere, I want to try
There's no turning back when life seems so far
Even if I die, dying is moving on

I'm dying away, I'm dying away and the now is now forever

I forgot my own voice. I drank from Lethe too long
I was the one who saw the gate
To the Orphic void, and dared to pass

I made up my mind, this will be my last
Even if it leads nowhere, I want to try
There's no turning back when life seems so far
Even if I die, dying is moving on
#CLAES#
I seek the seed of persistence
I breathe the very existence
I take away your sorrow and I’ll keep it all inside
You wander like there's no tomorrow
You're wasting time that won’t come back
You're a tiny thing in charge but not for long

Styx and Acheron, dividing us. Your own catabasis denied

So wasted your time for creation. So short your sight of damnation
I'm wrecking this boat for once, I could be a better man
The ferryman
It seems I'm losing control. No coin can fill this empty space
I'm wrecking this boat for once, I could be a better man
The ferryman

A sordid god, poor in richness
I faced eternity, fearless
May I breathe for once? May I see the Sun?

So wasted your time for creation. So short your sight of damnation
I'm wrecking this boat for once, I could be a better man
The ferryman
It seems I'm losing control. No coin can fill this empty space
I'm wrecking this boat for once, I could be a better man
The ferryman

I climb the dark to the outside world,
I want to see what they call home,
I want to die and meet the ferryman.

A stream of light shuts my eyes
Vapors surround me, they hold me back
So alone, I've lost track
Through desolation is my way out

Let me pray to the god of waste
To red vines which give my soul comfort
This wrong you are running from
Becomes the symbol of humanity's loss
Lead the trees under your spell
Lead the rocks which stoned my nature
I'm yours in my purest form
To come to you, you must free me

A stream of light shuts my eyes
Vapors surround me, they hold me back
So alone, I've lost track
Through desolation is my way out

Let me pray for Apollo's son
For the Sun which gives life to all things
This road will lead to death
And seal the gates of humanity's pain

I shall imitate the gods
The siren-sound which call us all
I shall emulate their powers
And I'll shiver in the deathly cold
I shall pay for my weakness
I sink into nothing

Y así nos iremos todos, dándole paso al silencio,
Dejando versos sin decir, dejando nada más que ausencia,
Hundiéndonos en la nada, separándonos del Ser

I sink into nothing
#CLAES#
Out of control, we fall
Into this life to taste the Self
I know we are coming from the darkness
One day we must return

All rites belong to me
I filled the void, the shadows
The one who's loud over the silence
Can walk out from this life into the next

You who brings the light under the earth
And like a beast, you feast
With the souls of the dead
Grant me entrance, let me in

Light the incense, turn to face south
Inscribe the symbol. Recite:
"When life is ending,
Then life begins"

I am flowing in the stream of time
#CLAES#
Build our future on the shoulders
Of a past that will be ignored
A new machine
A world creator
Our path to salvation

Look only to the sky that we have known
Forget about our dying home

Create our paradise
Terraform a newer world
Where we live beyond the sun
Destroy the past we know
Our next lives and our high hopes
Took a billion lives
That will never know our name
Our next rebirth
And our new earth
Our clean slate
We will never know their names

Advanced technology
It took everything from our minds
A nexus of deliverance
From our betrayal that will live on

Our new era born
Our new era born

Create our paradise
Terraform a newer world
Where we live beyond the sun
Destroy the past we know
Our next lives and our high hopes
Took a billion lives
That will never know our name
Our next rebirth
And our new earth
Our clean slate
We will never know their names

Nothing feels real
Silhouettes and figments
Separated by digital screens
Our eyes have created these visions

Are we dreaming
Our shock
Our mind betrayed
This is reality
Frozen in our eyes
What we see is real


Human blood has spilled
Under black lit sky
Hear the echoed screams
Dissipate like mist
Our eyes have created these visions

Are we dreaming
Our shock
Our mind betrayed
This is reality
Frozen in our eyes
What we see is real

Our eyes have created these visions

Are we dreaming
Our shock
Our mind betrayed
This is reality
Frozen in our eyes

Self-preservation lives in the mind
Our greatest instinct is to survive
But our will to outlive our own lives
Means we run
And we run against the wheel of time

Where to pass the smoldered flame
When every path is gone
Carve a new way to the sun
Mass exodus
Flee to the stars above

When the skyline falls
(When the skyline falls)
And the daylight calling is the light we seek
Raise us above
As our hope is fading
(As our hope is fading)
And the backdrop of the future stars await
Carry us on

Our roots are buried deep in the soil
Refuse to let them wither away
But the choice
Is not ours to remain
Now we fly
And we fly into the darkest night

Where to pass the smoldered flame
When every path is gone
Carve a new way to the sun
Mass exodus
Flee to the stars above

When the skyline falls
(When the skyline falls)
And the daylight calling is the light we seek
Raise us above
As our hope is fading
(As our hope is fading)
And the backdrop of the future stars await
Carry us on
#CLAES#
All will crumble under crimson skies
Before the dawn of another nightmare
Can we sever ties to
Pasts that plague us
Under judgement now
By machines that know not of forgiveness
Will we submit to the soil

A complex web of circuits
Perceives itself a mind
Beyond the depths of human soul
A cybernetic core of our own

Penetrate their lines
Push beyond the sentinels
Find the machines heart
Destroy the source to free us
Free us from this hell

A complex web of circuits
Perceives itself a mind
Beyond the depths of human soul
A cybernetic core of our own

All was lost when we forgot our way
Proclaimed ourselves sole martyrs
From our ancient ways
Do we know who is to blame
Each cell programmed to live on
The true nature of the human way
We must survive
So how do we accept the end
#CLAES#
Breathe into the harrowing wind
To uncover truths hidden by snow
Melting water cleanses the ground

Breathe into the freezing haze
The cold burns like salt in a wound

Howl
Your skull is screaming
The sky darkens
Visions dragged from light
Ice pierces your skin
Carving wounds from within

Pain moves through every vein
Frost covers figures too dim for you to see

Years go by faster
Seasons no longer hold their line
From its den under the mountain
Wings spread out across the night

Howl
Your skull is screaming
The sky darkens
Visions dragged from light

Pain moves through every vein
Frost covers figures too dim for you to see

The cold burns
#CLAES#
Screams that linger still
Like nails buried deep

Blind faith reigns forever
Far beyond their vision of truth

They stood
Where memories pass
A mark
A premonition of what's to come

Waiting - watching

Born from a broken womb
Pain is breeding life
Deliver names of the chosen
Until a silver lining cracks the sky

Blind faith reigns forever
Far beyond their vision of truth

Blind faith reigns forever
#CLAES#
Someone's calling out my name
I hear the echo, bleak and frail
Every time I close my eyes
I see you

Something's moving up ahead
Shadows flickering and vague
My feet are cold, my eyes are dim
As I fall down

Beneath a sky of black and blue
Into a night that never ends
Every time I close my eyes
I see you
#CLAES#
The last birds have left
Exiled by winter
Lights of the north
A dancing halo

Stretching over mountains
The whispers forge every lake

Far have you wandered
Lay down
Close your eyes
Embrace the final rest
Long lasting calls wither and die

A fading sun
A falling star
A growing rage
A distant roar

Your fire betrayed you
The scent reveals where you hide
Shadows reaching to claim your reeking skin
Signs of a storm, no need to repent
This wall is heading for you, its will is your end
#CLAES#
Clarity, don't let me down now
Clarity, don't let me down
Clarity, don't let me down
Clarity, don't let me down
You're killing me

Disgrace to my flesh and blood
My pain didn't say enough
Here and gone
Burned into the songs
The legacy has come undone
You said you didn't deserve this
That my truth struck a nerve
Well I meant every word
I was disregarded
Dragged my skull to the curb
You fucked me up again
Mind inanimate, un-compassionate
As if I hurt you for the thrill of it
But you're deaf, self-entwined
My history is being undermined
Clarity, don't let me down now
Clarity, don't let me down
You're killing me

Make of me, your scapegoat
Pull me to the shadows
Hold me ransom in chains
Cut out my tongue and curse my name

I'm the lamb of sacrifice for your mistakes
Lead me to the slaughter now we're at a stalemate
Blame it on the past, tell me we're condemned
Nothing's going to change, we're already dead

Clarity, don't let me down now
Clarity, don't let me down
You're killing me
#CLAES#
Have you tried turning it off
Taking a break?
When nobody is watching do you make the same mistakes?
Is it loud in there?
It's ringing on and on
White noise poisons all your choices
Haunting you in different voices

Praying I go deaf in this echo chamber
Praying I go deaf in this echo chamber
Something's gotta give sooner or later
Praying I go deaf in this echo chamber

Have you tried turning it off
Looking away?
The free mind of a stranger sears the tether to your brain

It cuts you deep
You feel ashamed
The only thing that matters
Is what you can create

Praying I go deaf in this echo chamber
Praying I go deaf in this echo chamber
Something's gotta give sooner or later
Praying I go deaf in this echo chamber
Echo chamber

Praying I go deaf in this echo chamber
Praying I go deaf in this echo chamber
Something's gotta give sooner or later
Praying I go deaf until there's nothing left

The free mind of a stranger sears
The tether to your brain
The only thing that matters
Is what you can create

Re-emerging as a monster
Re-emerging as a monster

I'll never be ready to meet a memory
I'll never be ready to meet a memory
A memory that abandoned me

Falling silent, going mad
I've gone walkabout
With the parasites in my head
Far too quiet, it's deafening
As I pick away at the surface
The itch burns through my skin

When the dirt crushes my bones
And the worms call me their home
If I'm asked to start again
I can't pretend I'm ready
I can't pretend I've had plenty

Drown this broken dream
A taste was quiet enough for me
My mind's too unsteady
Stay away from me, please

I'll never be ready to meet a memory that abandoned me
I'll never be ready to meet a memory that abandoned me

When the dirt crushes my bones
(I'll never be ready to meet a memory)
And the worms call me their home
(A memory that abandoned me)
If I'm asked to start again
I can't pretend I'm ready
I can't pretend I've had plenty

I'll never be ready to meet a memory
A memory that abandoned me
I'll never be ready to meet a memory
A memory that abandoned me

In cycles of voracity
We radiate human decay
Lost within the lines we've drawn
It's futile, we're too far gone
We're too far gone

We're infinite points to a star
Transformed into a meteor
We crashed into the universe
And turned it to obsidian
We're our own gods
Holding torches to the cauldron
Desensitized to burning corpses

In cycles of voracity
We radiate human decay
Lost within the lines we've drawn
It's futile, we're too far gone
Too far gone
It's futile, we're too far gone

Tired catastrophe
Radiating in our skin
Closing in on the glitch
Breaking down from within
Eclipse our sin

We let the poison win
We're too far gone

I'm falling, falling in
Into my head

I'm falling, falling in
Into my head
Walking against the wind
Dark solitaire

I'm roaming these paper streets
Hoping no one will find me
You wouldn't even recognize my face

I'm navigating pain
I'm circling the drain
Maybe the journey will open up the sky
The ghost of a memory won't let me say goodbye
Won't let me say goodbye

I'm falling, falling in
I'm still trying to be what I see in myself
I'm still trying to be what I see in myself
I'm still trying to be what I see in myself
But I need help

Inside, watching the core
Of whatever we had left of our lives
The multiplications divide
We drink to quench the thirst to come
With the bones that we left the trap was sprung

Blind ancient and malevolent, cosmos divides
The truth is we never ever had truth in sight
We spat on this purpose
We ate of whatever was left
The chasm beneath us will open and swallow the rest

Me the broken cog
You seem to not have understood
Knives out, strings set in motion
You act like you're surprised
Preemptive strike. Ruin. Chaos. Focus

Relentless and inexorable, this menacing creation
That we ourselves conceived with covetous verve and credulity.
Something this intensely profound can never be allowed
The fabric and all that holds it, will all burn. It will all be torn down

To contain it in its lair - Pandora's quantum prison
In wave after wave it will see us fail

Consign to oblivion this thing we cannot grasp
Bury deep this entity. Unlearn it ever existed

This is our omega. Factitious nemesis
The great dismantler of our dominion

If ever there was a reason - Maintain this greatest lie
That never did we look into the abysmal eye
#CLAES#
Blinded, gagged and bound by confirmation
On this premise we iterate a lie
Why will stay unasked
They know, we know. It doesn't matter

Barren hollow words. No information
We're led to believe in self-applied deceit
This trope of ignorance. Disinformation
Made to confuse, to light the shortening fuse

Wading through the rubble of ideologies
Cherry-picking madness to the gospel of suckers
Sustenance for the greatest of ideas
Life is a machine. It will cater to me. Bow. Serve. Comply

Bared teeth, the lesson is complete
The stench of strange raw meat
Draw acolytes to feast
Rotting thoughts the treat

So who came up with your ideas
Before you spat them out like they were yours
Play the pawn, knowing where hope lies
Where it goes to die
#CLAES#
From the realms of past my demons howl
Beyond bridges I lit they learned to fly
Apparitions, these ghosts of distant memory
Spectres. Remnants that just will not die

All my wrongs, my indiscretions they carry
From across the boundaries of time
The burdens I left for them to hold
Presented, laid out before my eyes

In their frozen gaze the blame
The questions to my lies
How hard I have tried to bury this
Yet here they stand before me
Phantoms
#CLAES#
So here we are. Tearing at flesh to scar
Carving the mark in servitude of the dark
Realign the weaponry of your mind
A surgical strike. Nothing left to find

The ghost of sacrifices made, lingering in the shadows
Perversion is the trade. So this will hurt in every way
But you will crave me, beg me to stay

And it flows through every fiber, runs through every vein
Twisted energy. Tracing insanity through ligature marks
Bruises formed in the dark

Facing the music, you've never heard this song before
A solemn requiem, a shroud for your machination and strife
Intent to euthanize

Empty sheet nothing left to deplete
The loop becomes complete
The void will swallow the melting stars
Suspended in emptiness
Torment turns to bliss. A stillborn genesis

On the throne sits the snake
Coiled and irate. Self righteous. Unforgiving
Lies lining the fork of his tongue, drip from his fangs
Inflicting wounds that never mend
Omnipotent God he sees in mirrors. Seraphic

From atop the growing tower of our bones,
Indifferently condemning all
At his whim our dismal fate
From his mouth but venomous gall
Ophidian. Slithering. Deceitful serpentine

Illustrious morph of man
Despot in guise of savior
Any blame he will carelessly relinquish
Like shedding his skin

Ophidian. Slithering. Deceitful
Through the vast of death he caused he winds. Serpentine

Never again shall we suffer the hissing
The subversive, malicious lies lining the fork of his tongue
Drip from his fangs
Inflicting wounds that never mend
Omnipotent God he sees in mirrors
#CLAES#
This untethering from logic
This beautiful, terrifying state
Astonishing. Uninhibited
Maddening. Euphoric

I now see through you. Translucent entities
Gone is the veil of sanity
The colors I now discern
Veracity as a boundless spectrum

A vast kaleidoscope
Spiraling enlightenment
Magnificent altered condition
Confined no more my vision

Inert and bursting. Here impossibles co-exist
In this vibrant domain truth is anything you dream it is

Here I can sense true fulfillment
Shedding the old, finding a new I
Devoid of restraints. Exempt from your lies
#CLAES#
Look at him yearning. Desirous
His craving, his hunger. Constant needs, constant wants
Nothing will quell, nothing will slake
Insatiable vacuous man

Hollow and see-through. His emptiness has made him frail
That dying thing still believes others drive the nails
Incendiary god complex. Such gift to flammable man
This is what it made of him. This is what remains

Behold, how he devours. Unappeasable and cursed
That arid soul, famished and desiccated
I am that thirst

His gluttony can not be stilled
This state can never be reversed
Hollow and empty. Endlessly
#CLAES#
A slow violence of words
This injurious game you play
Spiteful syllable strings
Arranged and tied into weapons

The incisions of your tongue, the slashing
The deliberate cuts run deep and wide
Whatever carved the pedestal you occupy
Was set on this resulting divide

I see through your vain pretense
The veil of you has been parted
Pure and fair you fly on wings up high
Pharisaical. You are faultless

Oh all the wounds I expected
- Heartbreak, bereavement and despair
I never saw these coming
- The gashes of your betrayal
#CLAES#
The awe it instills. How grand this revolting spectacle
Beyond what we can fathom. So far detached from reason
I quiver before it, I tremble
I see your vision. This bleak truth you contrive

Magnificent this vile display
The march of a recurring echo
Jericho trumpets blaring - again they sound
And the old armies of the misled rebuild. Reassemble

I will not swallow the bile, the putrid ideals you regurgitate

A conviction saturated with imbecility
Adopting the course of the blind
Unanimous in your revolting declaration
Conjured by offensive, feeble beehive minds

A pandemic, this contagion you embrace
The poison that seeps from your piteous souls
Armies of the preposterous, trapped in misguided thrall
Your mere existence shames us all

I will never assimilate your point of view
I see your vision, this bleak truth you contrive

It's been a long time coming
I'm coming back for you, my friend
To where we'd hide as children
I'm coming back for you, my friend

Though my memories are faded
They come back to haunt me once again
And though my mind is somewhat jaded
Now it's time for me to strike again
Tonight

It's a hunter's moon

Under a headstone, sister
I'm dying to see you, my friend
Back in the old cemetery
I'm dying to see you, my friend

Though my memories are faded
They come back to haunt me once again
And though my mind is somewhat jaded
Now it's time for me to strike again
Tonight

It's a hunter's moon

Ooh I'm coming
I'm dying
To see you one last time together

Though my memories are faded
They come back to haunt me once again
And though my mind is somewhat jaded
Now it's time for me to strike again
I'm coming back for you, my friend
Tonight

It's a hunter's moon

There was a time, not so long ago
You came to our side
Sisters and brothers confessing their creed
By the Hammer, unified

Through fire and ice, and through thunderous skies
For better and for worse
A lifetime devotion, a glorious call
Bringing magic to our heavy metal ball

We hear our brothers sing along
While our sisters standing strong
We would not be here without you

Onward we march through the fires of hell
Just to be first at the strike of the bell

Welcome inside the scene of the crime
Our sanctified domain
We bring the action, the hammer will fall
We are one, we are untamed

We all remember, and we'll never forget
The Templars made of steel
With hearts made of fire you bang to the beat
Raise your fist and get your ass up from your seat

There's no sleep 'til morning
Until a new day's dawning
Scream and shout, let it all out

Onward we march through the fires of hell
Just to be first at the strike of the bell
Brotherhood open for one and for all
Hammers held high we are heeding the call

If you don't like it there is the door
Heavy is our metal, hear our mighty roar

Onward we march through the fires of hell
Just to be first at the strike of the bell
Brotherhood open for one and for all
Hammers held high we are heeding the call
#CLAES#
I am me, I am the one
The brightest shining sun
A demon-ridden warrior
Ravaged to the bone

I run on blitzkrieg gasoline
I move without a sound
The hammer is my choice of arms
Need no back up plan

Never been to Valhalla
Witnessed old Asgard's delight
No, my home lies beneath us
Through fire and ice, alone in my fight

I am I, I am me
Heart of steel, no son of Odin
I am strong, I am brave
Let the hammer pave the way

From the day that I was born
I've been misunderstood
I broke new grounds, I set the sails
Played by my own rules

Lightning strikes and thunder roar
I've seen my destiny
I'm the hammer, the hammer is me
Pounding to be free

Watch me wind up the power
Relentless pursuing my foes
I am fierce eyed and evil
Hell's gonna follow wherever I go

I am I, I am me
Heart of steel, no son of Odin
I am strong, I am brave
Let the hammer pave the way

No Norse God from Asgard, I bow to my own creed
My hammer is pounding I am a lethal wielding breed

I am I, I am me
Heart of steel, no son of Odin
I am strong, I am brave
Let the hammer pave the way

Since the beginning I stood my ground
I stuck to my promises, what goes around comes around
Untamed by nature, rebellious by heart
My life's my manifest, I am a state of the art

Make me immortal, venerate me and rejoice
Let my second death be halted, be my endless voice

Say my name, and I will never die
Light my flame, on the forever sky

I talked the big talk, I backed it up
Delivered the goods when the saboteurs told me to stop
I walked through fire when I walked the walk
Make sure that my second death never breaks out of its lock

I lived a noble life and practiced what I preached
To the sound of my own drum, I was always out of reach

Say my name, and I will never die
Light my flame, on the forever sky
Say my name, be my last battle cry
Light my flame, on the forever sky

Say my name, and I will never die
Light my flame, on the forever sky
Say my name, be my last battle cry
Light my flame, on the forever sky

I am free like an eagle
Spreading my wings in the sky
Protecting the wings that are changing
Therefore I must give the eye
I know we must defend it
From those who would take it away
There is a price for this freedom
Way more than we wish to pay

Nothing's free in freedom
Pay the price
There's no cost reduction
To paradise

Live free or die
Come and break the chains or do not come at all
Live free or die
Come on, shout it out and heed the freedom call

By the blood of my brothers
I do solemnly swear
To spread the gospel of freedom
Even if nobody cares
No way to alter the past times
Rewrite our lost yesteryears
Only one thing to remember
That freedom smells nothing like fear

I'll ignite the fire
Roll the dice
Let us stand together
Break the ice

Live free or die
Come and break the chains or do not come at all
Live free or die
Come on, shout it out and heed the freedom call

Nothing's free in freedom
Pay the price
There's no cost reduction
To paradise

Come and break the chains or do not come at all
Live free or die

Live free or die
Come and break the chains or do not come at all
Live free or die
Come on, shout it out and heed the freedom call

The manner that I choose
One banner, win or lose
Forever, standing proud
Together, shout it out

Voices are calling, deep down the watery trail
Icy winds blowing, heavy rain ripping our sail

Raging thunder from the wild blue yonder
Free the fury, here I am

The manner that I choose
One banner, win or lose
Forever, standing proud
Together, shout it out

New days are dawning, repression will cease to exist
Water, the holy, luring us into the mist

Pillage, plunder, feed the flames down under
Winds of winter rule the wild

The manner that I choose
One banner, win or lose
Forever, standing proud
Together, shout it out

Close to the edge
Of disappearance
Faint features
Still existing
Yet somehow
Drawn towards
The greater absence

Immersed in loss
Of something
That once was
And finally gave way
To the most
Distant darkness

A touch of languid depression

A wound of conscience

The slow dissolution

Of existence
#CLAES#
Long after
It was too late
To find back
All meaningful
The glow long gone
The spark faded (and smothered)
And though I saw
The others
Advance and vanish into the
distance
I chose to stay behind
To wander astray
To remain unfound
To merge with these dark thoughts
As I saw and felt this existence
As mere reflection
In slow time
#CLAES#
As if through the mist
Fading slow
From this moment
From this life

Of no fulfillment
Of no discovery

Only the passing
Only the flow...

Leaving from all
That once had a meaning

To reach deep
For the inner desolation

To awaken the emptiness
That was always there
Here, in the stillness
A yearning
For an ending
#CLAES#
Pious, traitor, seducer of angels
Acts of sin committed under God
Unseen vile intrusion
While you bear your righteous cross
An acolyte's nightmare, perverted Holy See
Raping his angels beneath pontifical wings
Deceptive dark perversion
While you kiss the holy ring
Playing the holy
While feeding your demons
Pupil of God
Formed of a devil's soul
Acts of cruelty, acts of shame
Acts of torture, an act of God
Treachery within the house of God
Where the wicked hide amongst the saints
Stalking those of purest spirit
A predator's scheme of dark intent
Deceitful wolf adorned in cloths of faith
Ordain yourself in stolen souls
Pray for those you've preyed upon
While hidden away in secrecy
Acts of cruelty, acts of shame
Acts of torture, an act of God
#CLAES#
Chaos breaks the silent air
A deadly threat upon us
Let fly your pernicious barbs
Initiate the bloodshed
This insane crusade
Tragedy of doomed faith
To violence we are slaves
Usurpers of this sacred realm
Shake the earth beneath us
Archangels stab with spears of hate
Our fragile world held hostage
Our foundation is frayed
Populace in disgrace
So blind to its disease
The dark you cast spreads slow and deep
Like God empowered kings at your feet
A furious maelstrom of fire and destruction will reign
Take us back to the age of no light once again
The death you bring runs far and wide
A God possessed, a world destroyed
#CLAES#
Black rays spew down from the heavens
Burning rampant through the flaws of man
Holy servants sworn to guide us towards salvation
Now fallen angels leading us to sin, leading us to sin
This fractured sect pierces through our conscience
Deliverance promised to stop our dark descent
This crowning vision, wrapped so tight around us
Chokes us all, as the thorns dig in, as the thorns dig in
Symbolic burden of pain
We wash our hands of your stain
This crown will fall and choke us all
A noose of thorns, a noose of scorn
When judgement calls
Will you be absolved?
Will you find your way?
Or be strangled by your faith forever
Constrict and tighten around our necks
Bleeding wounds, drown from within
Poisoned souls forever damned
A noose of thorns to keep us pure
#CLAES#
Monarch of useless ruin
Your fatal harvest grows nothing but human waste
With the blackest of tongues, like the power of the sun
You can give life or take it away
Conjurer of false illusion
Your tainted lies hold nothing but septic hopes
Wrapped in the trust of a shining cross
Will they ever shed this light and see
The truth
From your throne you've left us all to die
Again
Inciting viscous whispers
Fall on willing ears
Sick obedience mastered
Strengthened by your fear
Wild and mindless furor
Your devout lash out in anger
Fierce relentless battles
Designed to make us suffer
Your promised light was the only way
But your path of myths brings darker days
Shed this light
Wake and rise
Shed this light
Wake or die
In the blinding glow of your craven prophets
They steal this precious life from within your veins
Peel away the rotten layers
And tear yourselves away from their torturous light

Ritualistic urge
To dominate and purge
Sadistic rite of passage
Dissociate from all
Imbued with manic thoughts
Bring senseless terror so savage
Yeah
Covered in their blood
Bask in primal rage
Drink deeply of their pain
Such willingness to taste
Cathartic throes of glory
The hunted will be slain
Unbridled acts of violence
Anointed in their blood
God's power you now hold as your own
Christened thief of chosen souls
Servant of death
Serving the highest
Emotionless spirit
Grants this trophy of pride
Yeah
Harrowing visage, frozen in time, psychotic disdain
Creature of prey, the hunt goes on, now master of fate
Master of fate
Blood for the kill
Blood feeds desire
With rapturous fury
You take your first life
#CLAES#
Propaganda set ablaze
Shifting doubt and fear to rage
Antagonize our enemies into conflict
Another poison apple drops
We hate the taste yet eat it up
Death clears way for new acquisitions
Choking down disease and filth
Assassinations without guilt
Devolve into the devils wretched pawns
Discordant villains seed the earth
With famine, plague and war
Spiral downward, ever falling
Endless battles, hostility from which we cannot hide
Endless death, eradication brought down on us
Seething carnal masses awaiting night
Advancing closer, in somber hues of light
Poised and rabid, their armies thirst for life
Their venomous tongues numb us
With caustic hymns of glory
Our peaceful souls will slowly die
In their molten swells of fury
Conquer and divide
The weak and dispossessed
The ravaged flesh of apocalyptic quest
The wicked shall overcome us
#CLAES#
We sleep eternal in our graves
Now all awaken to our screams
In ghostly winds our cries are heard
Our pain and suffering always known
Assimilate, exterminate
Pawns of Christ deny us life
We lie within cold folds of earth
The sky above us made of dirt
No light of day nor warmth of touch
Our severed bloodlines come to rest
Cleanse the world of our blood
Pawns of God steal our light
Invade their lives and rob their young
Wipe their minds and mother tongue
As cinders light the path ahead
Trickling down upon the dead
Flames of vengeance consume the night
Burn the devil's house for spite
Poisoned us with your disease
Raped of spirit, mind and body
Tortured, killed, to the ground we're fed
Bones to mark our hidden beds
In the darkened rays of holy light
We'll dig our graves before the dawn
Our mortal stain they will erase
Hide away in disgrace
Pawns of Christ dispatch your saints
One by one, until nothing remains
#CLAES#
Towards the end we march
The flames call out to us
Unstoppable temptation
Our course forever locked
Chasing domination
Gave way to devastation
At a calming pace we've taken
All the steps to obliteration
A storm of immense cleansing flame
Incinerating all to blame
Screaming in pain as they burn
The crimes of man left in heaping piles of ash
Fire like rain will fall
Silence is given to all
Deities and demons no more
Innocence gone, shame on us all
From spark to flame to raging mass infernos
We lit the fuse and watched it grow to burn us
An ascending cloud of souls is all we've left
And with us goes a world of useless suffering
Marching on, ignore the signs
Thick ash above, blot out the sun
Marching on until extinction comes
Incineration procession
#CLAES#
Converging on us
With blood-soaked greed
Scouring the wastelands
On suffering they feed
The scent of death
Draws them near
The leeches take hold
Pick our bones clean
Scavengers
In a sea of human wreckage
Unfortunate souls
Left victim to the plight of man
As the tyranny of man is unleashed upon us all
We're cast into its dismal aftermath
A symptom of our gradual decline
Devouring all these broken lives have left
Beaten and ravaged they lay
The vultures circle their prey
Descending through smoke filled fires
The vulnerable will not survive
Revel in misery
To bleed us dry
The vermin strike at will
Swift in their attack

Penitent ones, self-righteous ones
Feigning remorse, yet persistent in sin
Obstinate ones, faithful to none
Displaying devotion, yet abandoning your god
Deceivers, deserters
Betrayers of light unfaithful in your hearts
Chasing old ghosts for your redemption
Sinful minds absorbed in self-desires
A dereliction of your spirit
Angelic ones, envious ones
Promising love, yet spreading their wings of hate
Liars, tempters
Betrayers of light unfaithful in your minds
Chasing old ghosts for your redemption
Driving the stakes into your savior's heart
A dereliction of your spirit
Superior, infallible, your arrogance disgusts us all
Mighty, high, above the rest, but no stones will you ever cast
Transgressors of sanctity, who are you to judge us
We abominate your holy faith until you prove us wrong
Blessed ones, holiest ones
Obsessive ones, devious ones
Malicious ones, destructive ones
Frightening ones, deadliest ones
Betrayers will burn

Grand majesty in full control
A perfect plan for us all
A balance kept throughout all time
Burning through every soul divine
Willing souls serve up to you
And the sainted ones will feast
In service to their gilded gods
Whose thrones they seek to reach
Take of the body, take of the blood
These sacraments of your lord
Focus on our flaws and shame
Intimidate, terrorize for gain
Crippled minds to warp and bend
To eternal fire the heretics we'll send
Hark, your hateful angels sing
Of pain, death and suffering
Awaiting signs of your sanctity
Forever pray on broken knees
Fed your bread, served your wine
These sacraments spit out in vain
In the darkened rays of your holy light
Scorching us all as your touch ignites
We pray, we fight, we die
We hold your sacred sigils high
Upon our backs your cross we bear
Upon your heads these halos burn
In the darkened rays of your holy light
Scorching us all as your touch ignites
Oh, sainted ones, oh blessed sons
Cast down in flame when halos burn

I've known true anguish
I've once felt light
A broken spirit, I stand alone
My fortress of one
The past has brought me back to this place
I'm drifting lifeless once again
Lost beneath a shroud of night
The sun's warm rays never in my sight
This taste of black on my tongue
Can't erase the things I've done
My fortress of guilt
I hate what I am
No pain is greater than the truth
This pounding, pounding in my head
I cannot let them in
My inner demons taunting me
I must not lead them here
Lead me out of the light
Bring me into the
Darkness creeping close to me
I feel its numbing grasp
I know its cold emphatic call
I cannot break its spell
Lead me into the dark
Bring me closer to
Malignant spirits have entered my soul
Let the darkness come inside again
Departing life
My tormented soul
Submit and die
Let the darkness in

From the bloodied altars
Of the wicked king
Come poison doctrines
Of Godless rage
From the fetid gutters
Of sickened minds
Come corrosive diatribes
Aimed to destroy
Lead them to madness
Let me haunt you with these words
This chorus of evil
Resounding, dark, triumphant
Worship and trust, devote yourselves to us
Murderous lust, follow through you must
In flashing scenes of horror
Come pestilential storms
Piercing placid dreams
Awoken by our thunder
Explosive bursts of death
Bring coffins to the earth
In chaotic waves of hate
The skies rain down our venom
Sacrifice, the hounds will bleed
Crippling fear, bait them with terror
Growing beneath, our roots, so far will reach
Programmed to destroy, our perfect soldier
Forever the monster
Our secrets held deep
After the purge
Their silence will keep
Lead them to sorrow
Through taunting cryptic verse
This chorus of pain
Resounding, dark, triumphant

Ice it shattered into shards
Gave away under our feet
Many men did lose their lives
Taken by Tuonela's river

In the blue frost of the night
In the icy waters of death
Stifled were both wail and whisper
Frozen were the living hearts

The days they followed each other
Nights defended our dreams
With the seasons grew our circle
And we knew we'd found our place

We would start from the beginning
Make it with our meager means
Crouching, cowering companions
Journeying ever northwards

Waking in the dead of night
My eyes opened in the darkness
I saw the sign of the red hand
Marking the mouth of a cave
On the sordid, stony ground
On a field of frozen grass
I found my spirit kith and kindred
My sisters and my brothers

Game is good and plentiful here
Happy is the life, the life of man
It was not in vain we came
Strayed from the silent waters

The days they followed each other
Nights defended our dreams
With the seasons grew our circle
And we knew we'd found our place

We would start from the beginning
Make it with our meager means
Crouching, cowering companions
Journeying ever northwards

On a rock like a tree
The one-eyed figure stands
Dauntlessly time and again
Breaking the salty wave

I guard this mountain
You circle me in the night

If you bow to the eye of stone
You'll hear a distant song
A story carried by the restless wind
Forevermore

The subdued silence of your lips
It commands only me
Unwavering my sinewy frame
The cold night it will endure

On this towering mountain
Your love even higher above

I roamed too far with heavy burden
Darkness swallowed the road behind me
Light ahead faded, I stumbled down
Only to loose my heart and give in

I took a tin bell from my treasure-pouch
Summoned the one blacker than night
Fire and calm in its eyes
Its mane was flying its fire and spirit

Rider, messenger
Hurry, go like the wind

On the misty meadows of spring
On the parched roads of summer
On the chequered paths of autumn
On winter's snowy trails

Its mind the tongue of burning flame
Swiftly carries its heavy burden
Under its hooves stony ground
Touching my heart, its timid strength
Its speed the sister of storm and wind
Its fearsome might it bestows upon me
It takes me home from lands of night
From killing fields it delivers me

Rider, messenger
Hurry, go like the wind

We wandered through strange lands
Traveling ever northwards
Crossing valleys, over mountains
To the shores of distant seas

As the world grew frozen and pale
Flowers withered, grass was dying
The thickest trees has lost their leaves
Wind brought in the scent of winter

In the cold night of the north
Our life was lodged by the pole star
Showing us the path to follow
Hammering down destiny
Forever

And as dawn shone over the ice
The morning star showed us the way
To our new homeland

Deer were wailing in the woodland
Grunting fiercely in their fervor
Bears clambered back to their caves
Grouses slept under the snow

Blackened was the sea a-storming
Raging white flew freezing foam
As the day sank to the west
Moon came out and froze the waters

In the cold night of the north
Our life was lodged by the pole star
Showing us the path to follow
Hammering down destiny
Forever

And as dawn shone over the ice
The morning star showed us the way
To our new homeland

The black-throat divers and the swallows
Dove deep down into the waters

In the cold night of the north
Our life was lodged by the pole star
Showing us the path to follow
Hammering down destiny

As worms upon the forest floor
Swarming were they and a-stirring
Twisting upwards and a-swirling
As eagles soaring to the sky

With the eyes of dragonflies
Ears of eager leather wings
On the wings of black-throat divers
By the honeyed paws of bears

Telling us what it means to be
Chanting us into being

Came the Gods to our people
Told us how a man should be
They taught us how to live our lives

Came the Gods to our people
Chanting us into the world
They taught us how to live our lives

They lead us to a woodland spring
To show us our shining reflection
There they attuned our senses
And fit us with ability

In the winds of the unknown
We heard the swan being to sing
The stars were our sure guides
Dreams showed us the way to go

Telling us what it means to be
Chanting us into being

Came the Gods to our people
Told us how a man should be
They taught us how to live our lives

Chanting us into the world

Stepping out in to the open
From the dark paths of the forest
You will know why you have traveled
Squinting your eyes in the light

When the sky arches above you
And the wood rustles and sighs
You are born into another place
Arrive in another time

Place your gifts on that stone
With a drop of your blood
Where seven roads come together
Offer a gift of honey
Give the fruits of your ghost
Where seven roads come together

You will see the silent meadow
Where seven roads come together
Shining calmly like a distant star
Where seven roads come together

You will see in the crossroads
A stone carried by ice
Rolled by waters of the past
Set in its place by time

Place your gifts on that stone
With a drop of your blood
Where seven roads come together
Offer a gift of honey
Give the fruits of your ghost
Where seven roads come together

Have led you astray
Remember that you've been in this place

Come to me my spirit bird
Pull the hair out from my head
Peck the eyes from shiny skull

Tear the tongue from my mouth
Carry me up to the crag
Shove me down into the sea

Sink me in the swirling eddies
Down into the deepest depth

Black is my hearth and my home
Ravaged my abode
All my hopes burnt to cinder
Burnt to cinder

Rob my mind and steal my soul
In my best clothing dress yourself

Take my place and what is mine
Go and fly to lightless lands
Soar the skies beneath the ground

There you can be as I once were
Take my place and what is mine
Rambling, rowing, upside down
Soar the skies beneath the ground

The sea rose and fell
The waves were crashing
Thrashing a piece of wood
Against the rocks

The surf took it ashore
A strange stick I found
To pick up and ponder
And turn in my hands

A white raven's skull
Fashioned by time and tide
And its gnarly lines
Furrowed by stone

I put together a halo
Out of pieces of amber
Carved my own marks
With a knife of bone

In the middle of the halo
I placed the raven's skull
Drew wings with charcoal
Painted a bird in ash

The bird took wing and flew
A raven cried in the wind
The images washed away by the sea

Drawn by daylight's quill
Embraced by the woods
In the shadow of the twilight

A sign lingered in my mind
Halo behind my eyes
Picture of amber bright
Glowing with bronze

I put together a halo
Out of pieces of amber
Carved my own marks
With a knife of bone

In the middle of the halo
I placed the raven's skull
Drew wings with charcoal
Painted a bird in ash

We wandered with the wolves in pursuit
The hunger hot on our heels
Scenting our bloody tracks
The fear that fails not to smell fear

Seemed we had the same direction
Following the fleeing deer
With fiery eyes watching each other
Cautiously circling and stalking

Winter's wind it howled and hollered
Gently blew the breeze of summer
Scudding were the storms of autumn
But southerly saw hope a-stirring

And howling in the haunted night
Sang the wolves of the wild
Shadows scurrying in the moonlight
Circling us in the darkness

Searing fire in our torches
With the cold light of the day
Fighting them time and again
We drove the wolves away

Winter's wind it howled and hollered
Gently blew the breeze of summer
Scudding were the storms of autumn
But southerly saw hope a-stirring

Bunt came the spring and misty morning
Through grey borders of sleep
I saw a wolf lie by our cave
Seeking me night after night

Winter's wind it howled and hollered
Gently blew the breeze of summer
Scudding were the storms of autumn
But southerly saw hope a-stirring

We drove the wolves away
We drove the wolves away

As the sun is turning crimson
I'm closing my eyes
I lay down my sword
My spear, bow and arrow
I lay my head on red earth
On dark twigs of spruce
On golden grass of meadow
On heather and rosemary

My name is night
My sword has been bent and broken
My story's burned to cinder
And my life's been sung away
My name is night
I will roam these mounds
I will take care of my own

For I'm sent on a journey
With my trestles to Tuonela
Dressed in my best clothes
Lifted on the pyre
The sun beyond the sea
Sets in wings of fire
Stones on top of the hill
A pile over high ashes

My name is night
My sword has been bent and broken
My story is burned to cinder
My life's been sung away
My name is night
I will roam these mounds
I will take care of my own

a slave to this hysteria, losing touch with what it's like to feel human,
I've been pieced together from crack rocks and heroin... I guess I'm gonna need help.
the sky above me can't be recognized, through this haze of crystallised demise.
I've got nothing to live for, but the love of being sick.

every time I fight back, I always start to relapse,
burn the foil and the black has got my eyes rolling back.
what a perfect tragedy, it has taken over me.
a constant back and forth, a fucking love and hate,
always down for my queen but I think she fucking hates me.

I was once the sun in her eyes, but now I'm just a long dead star that's been fucking hollowed out.
it's been ages since the heart in my chest has given me any warmth to live with,
my limbs have become atrophied and numb.

I can't even pull my face off the floor, I'm at the point where it might not even fucking matter anymore,
I've spent my life reaching for the hand that will lead me to my grave and whisper in my ear,
"just dig, build your home in the earth... just dig, make your bed with the worms writhing underneath our feet."

I see a fire in her eyes, a beacon shining in the night... a lure drawing me closer to the end of my life,
I found bliss in your lie.
I've got nothing to live for but the love of being sick,
I've got nothing to live for, so I'll just fucking dig

I breath you in... my addiction gets it's fix
#CLAES#
leave me alone,
I'm busy framing beauty within my peripheral,
blind my bloodshot eyes,
prepare the world to behold my slow dive into the hopeless emotion that I internalize,
another decaying youth for you to romanticize,
swallow my words, disguise this bitterness as a product of my vices

slowly sinking, drifting under the ice, that sleeps so silent, frozen and indifferent to my life,
sinking, waiting for the frost to set on my bones,
a hollow home, pain lives there, it thrives and it grows,
the closest friend I've never known

how could I have not fallen in love with the loath that was born in my veins, screaming in anger, screaming in anger

so don't ask me how I grew to hate myself,
I've spent my life screaming in silence at the world that spit me out,
death claims us all

as I gasp for air I feel a hand wrap around my throat,
pulling me deeper, a blessing like none I've ever known,
my saviour my friend, I'm not sure where you've been,
twenty years I've been living, craving for your attention

take me away,
take me away from this youth decay

I feel a consuming numbness take over me,
face turning blue, darkness from the suffocating,
ice filled lungs, internal frostbite,
death hold me, I give you my broken mind
#CLAES#
the night is silent except for the distant train of thought running through my mind.
I wonder why I'm awake, listening to the barely audible memories of you and me.
I miss the way you looked at me, so amused when I tried so desperately to fall asleep.
the little things just bore their way into my soul and tear me apart endlessly... this pain has no self control

everything falls back to me, the poisoned tree has bloomed the fruit of decay.

you told me I was your sun, when your eyes clung to the stars... a constant reminder that I was never enough.
this light pollution saves me from the pain of looking up to the sky and remembering everything.
like how we stood ten feet apart, blanketed in silence,
finally past the point of talking ourselves through this heartbreak.
the emptiness in the sky is eating me alive, you were the moon that guided me so gently through the fucking night.
through the night.
you were the moon that guided me so gently...

everything falls back to me, the poisoned tree has bloomed the fruit of decay.

everything I touch always turns to stone, everything I love always leaves these shaking bones.
these shaking bones, they crumble.
#CLAES#
The storm clouds move in overhead, drowning out the light of day.
Blinded in the darkness, soul torn apart by the falling rain.
Cold and alone, trembling with fear and shame.
Arms stretched to the sky as blood drips from my eyes, I wait for a break in the clouds.
Withered from the absence of glory, fruitless from the absence of light.
Barren from self-reliance, empty but not without hope.
I still remember the glory of the light; I know the power of the sun.
Amidst the despair, hope will prevail, as calm follows every storm.
Hungry for renewal, longing for the warmth that awaits, I wait for a break in the clouds.
#CLAES#
Reflecting upon history, things of the past that cannot change.
Self-inflicted torture, the everlasting pain of revisited experiences of yesterday.
Walking backwards through life ever dwelling on the uncontrollable.
Perception of hope withers to bitter disillusionment.
Ahead lies an unbeaten path, a road yet un-traveled, free from the wreckage of the trail behind.
A choice at hand, freedom or chains? Embrace the hope of a new day.
Cast off the shackles of haunted memories.
Embrace the Beauty of healing love and redemption.
Embrace a new beginning.
Leave behind all fear and trembling.
Embrace the glory that overshadows remembrance-borne misery.
Memories that once tore the soul apart, sealed away in a whitewashed history.
No longer strangled by a hopeless outlook.
Embrace the beauty of a new beginning.
Embrace the gift of grace and mercy.
#CLAES#
Did you ever expect to see me here? Did you ever expect to know my fear?
Did you ever expect to close your eyes? Did you ever expect that you would die?
Do you know who I am? I think your fear will show you.
Nightmare so beautiful, everywhere you'd least expect.
Master of manipulation, unknowingly you gave me control.
Come with me, take my hand; I'll lead you through this promise land.
Show you what you don't want to see.
Show you why you are here with me. Silently I scream your name, deaf though you are you head my cry.
Surrendering your soul to me, to gain freewill and fulfill desires.
Desires, which I've implanted in you, the life you lead I control.
Pure potential shines in the light. Charred and empty you lye by my side.
Cold, dark terror resides in your eyes as you gnash your teeth and realize I am real and you I own, eternally you'll writhe at my throne.
Pleads for mercy diminish in the night. Deliverance was offered, you denied.
Grace hung plainly before your eyes, refused to give up control of your life.
Ironically you did indeed, traded life to die with me.
#CLAES#
Wasting away, you fall, you fail, and I know you can't understand it.
Falling down you stay on the ground. You can't pull yourself up anymore.
Lost in the dark of duplicity, your loss only brings hate and despair.
Latent bitterness burns in your soul. Smoldering, burning from inside to out.
From experience I can tell you, when you hate you're just wasting your time.
Give your foe too much of yourself, he and destruction, you walk on the line.
Love your brother but hate the things he does to himself.
Serve one another the way you would have done to yourself.
What doesn't kill me just makes me weaker.
Logic defines your insistence to me that my faith conflicts with your reason.
My faith can illumine what you cannot see.
Watch your world crumble and fall around your ears. Denying the spirit your body will fail.
Yet the infinite reach of evil tinged logic envelops life with indelible strength.

Blood drips down the spine of the unknowing victim.
Tongue like steel plunges deep into the spirit, piercing more than just feelings, severing the ties of brotherhood.
Thought shot from the hip inflicts a mortal wound.
Festering contempt now burns darkly in the mind of the inflicted.
Clumsily worded, insincere apologies try to suture the wounds of the tongue, motivated by self-concern rather than remorse.
Nonchalant disregard for the implications of destructive comments fuels the corrosion of social unity.
Smile in their presence, slander in their absence.
Cut the flesh from their bones as their backs are turned.
Years of bitter tears can flow from a split second comment.
Words can never wash away the wounds of the tongue.
Only love and remorse can heal the spirit.
#CLAES#
Second nature instilled with pride. Honor, glory, unbroken stride.
Absence of dependence of dependence of absence. Square peg fills the void of a square hole.
Conviction and splendor, honesty unfolds.
Desperation unforgotten, far behind yet resides in the eyes of the cold.
Warm, warm contrast assaulting to the senses. Realization embrace.
Realization distaste. As if black on black, overlooked radiance, piercingly pure, frighteningly painful.
Bright ray of hope looked upon as dull.
Stricken with awe and disbelief.
Tears flow with joy, compassion, and grief.

Gazing into the eyes of a new creation, the intrinsic nature of design cannot be denied.
Stonehearted, stubborn mindset locked into a foolish confidence.
Skeptical of miracles yet miracles form the foundation of the rational alternative.
"Everything arose from nothing. Limitless complexity self-induced from chaos."
Religious perspective = emotional deception, jaded belief in a creative hand.
Secular gospels inherently absurd, scientific assumptions force-fed as fact.
Scientific open mind unwilling to observe the obvious, that everything arose from nothing.
Miracles designed by the divine, implemented with authority which mankind now denies.

In these, the Last Days
before Armageddon,
comes the mighty nightstorm, (and)
the Mist brings the Chosen

Black against blue,
the Raven has flown;
Darkness, now,

(now) there be fewer dogs,
with each swing of the Axe;
all Aktion is prayer:
pray with the Axe

And the Chosen?
Feed them to the Young Lions;
in this Hellscape,
Violence is golden

KILL on Command,
KILL with Hearts so cold,
KILL because you can:
Violence is Golden

In a religion based on feces,
all angels are soul-flies,
and white worms find the human,
the writhing human who dies

Craft shows its inverted hand,
with its sickly corpsewater shine,
to guide the white worms of Murder,
to show them where to dine

Blood sits in carrion Judgement
and damns to flies
to the chitinous song
of a billion carcass flies

Pestilence rides the Maggot Wind:
blood disease flies
to swell the ranks of the dead
and animate them as they rise

By brightest Crossmoon, all who die
grease the night with the scarlet cries;
the Witchspawn hunt with murderworms
and sculpt with flies

Exoskeletally enslaved,
the staring dead dream of the Grave
from Sister Grief and Mohter Chaos,
they can't be saved

the moon, in white dispassion,
will fly like a shroud of bones,
to sleep from feces in the soil,
to bleed from faces in the stone

Flesh for flesh, and souls to fall,
Filth and Madness do enthrall
the Sire of sin, who with his Fire
catches us all

In the charnel land of the Damned,
in a child's Garden of graves,
Insanity has planted
fields of the Crucified;
their heads point to the parched Earth
under vermillion skies

On each side of a blasted path,
as far as the Eye can see:
row upon row of crosses;
miasmic ill enshrouds
Perdition's umber implements
beneath black roiling clouds

To while away Eternity,
the godless lost bewail
their inverted Damnation
amid the vacant graves

Their demented cacophony
delights the Fallen Child,
who sowed Temptation's seeds
to watch his Nurslings writhe

This is the dawn of Nothingness (to be embraced):
the Dust, the dark, the gathering mass
...and the scraping tread of the dead on the Earth...

Jihad begins in earnest
with the taking of a pawn,
then a retaliatory strike
slicks the ground with blood

Black pawn's white neighbour to the front
is taken down, to be avenged by a Knight
the following moves involve more pawns (being)
slaughtered by Knights on both sides

Bishop takes pawn and pawn takes pawn
by way of return;
the next Move brings something Feminine, something diabolical
as Black Queen takes a white pawn,
and a white Tower crushes a black pawn in a skirmish further on...

There is only murder among us:
may it always be so

This is Manson's "Helter Skelter"
on an altogether different scale

pawn KILLS pawn,
then Bishop KILLS pawn,
then Bishop KILLS pawn

Leave us in our Silent Mansions,
in this place of sunlight and roses,
for nothing dies here, not anymore;
the Aktions are done, and we are dust

To the mad laughter of machineguns,
we descended into such along graves;
we subhumans, we bleed in darkness
that the light be not offended

We were here...
These are their houses, now,
and we are here

We were here...
This is Mourningside,
and we are here

We were here,
in this House of Tears...
now we are here

we were here:
this is where they wept;
now we are here

We caught fire
and burned so easily;
we blackened,
and then we were ash (we are ashes)
We rose to faces,
eyeless faces
that bleed black Grief
in endless oceans of Black Suffering

Now we are here,
like rat bones on a plague ship,
in thy Garden
where there are only Others...

Utter hatred,
an old-time hatred:
of this hatred
we are kin,
because some people are only good for bullets

Let's talk about your future:
simply stated, you don't have one;
let it all end without sweetness,
without the thoughtfulness of suicide

It's time to remove you from the world:
30 seconds in the killhouse aught to do (it);
(your) nudity offends me - blood is better,
complete with holes from an MG42

The trick is in the brutality:
it's all in how hard you play,
(but) I'm looking forward to a quiet hanging
at the end of a long, long day,
and then falling asleep
to the soft drip of a slit throat

The angel of conscience
has been displaced
by butchery's muse,
who is fairest of face...
Don't you wish I were sorry?
I love how your eyes abhor me

Let us indulge the Art of Wrath,
(let us) obey the Laws of Excess...

Everything is cold, finished... ruined
Every day is a funeral
There is no remorse
Do not repeat - We will repeat

debris, you are...
mud-dwellers all:

where you don't belong

Let your HATE be more lasting than the grave:
This is not "good bye,"
this is "see you on the Other Side"
you have useless-eaters' eyes
and mouths only open to bite or lie;
How fucking dare you breath?
You feed my unrelenting fucking hatred
You! Eat my UNRELENTING FUCKING HATRED!

Toilet slaves who eat shit and beg for it,
lusty bitches: bound, gagged and whipped,
a nine-year-old girl forced to give head:
but this is snuff - she gets pumped full of lead
and the walls came down,

and the song remains the same...

Masturbating amputees,
animals getting raped,
fetishism and sodomy:
porno shows us the Way

Rubber diapers, sit on his back:
inflamed ass gets twenty more whacks;
motorized genitals, turning a trick:
we call it love, you call it sick;
There's give and there's take,
but the more things change,
the more they remain the same...

Espying the splayed chest cavity,

The grotesquely displayed anatomy...
Organs displaced with steel forceps,

Ensanguined guts arouse the mixoscopic,
His voyeuristic experience facilitated by masturbation...
Evacuation of the omentum proceeds,
As connective tissue is ripped,
This intense vicarious carnal diversion,
Peaks as embalming fluid drips...
Fomented by images so gory and sick...

He views the peritoneal chasm,
Satiating his troilistic perversion,
The scoptophilic acheives orgasm...
A testicular ejaculatroy spasm...

Malignant sores seep,
Pustules erupt with cheese,
Degeneration of epithelium,

Giving rise to a myriad of metastic moppets,
Lambasted by lesions and suffering tissue rejection,
As your countenance glides off in deliquesced droplets...

Infected layers of skin disembogue in sullied chunks,
Cleaved from connective tissue by fitful hands,
Your long face accentuated by pendulant flesh,
Debilitated by an aberration in the DNA strand...

Corpulent moles and warts,
Symptoms of the sarcoma,
Abrading the neoplasm,
You avulse the keratoma...

A tumorous husk is amassed and left to decay,
Emitting a foul septic aroma,
Ameliorate the disease through total dermal regeneration,
You slough the gory melanoma...
Irradiated and mutated,
Cancerous cells deviate,
Carcinogens and pathogens,
The integument you exuviate...

The madness awakens, the hellfires blazing
From unknown dimensions he hails
His resurrection, his thirst for redemption, christianity infidel
The sinister being, attacking the fleeing
His labyrinth a black putrid sea
Nothing is sacred, and nothing is holy
For death will be dealt unto thee

For generations he has slain, damning souls for satan's reign
The number 6 is chanted thrice, invoking the Anti-christ
From the depths he will arise, sending fear into their lives
Seeking blood and craving flesh, comsuming 'til the very end
Wails, and howling in the darkness, screams echo through the night, beast lurking in the shadows, death summons
Awaiting the kill!!!

Loathing and fearing, and screaming and running
There's no place to hide or ecape
Ghastly creature, his sadistic reason
Death, doom and torment is your fate
The ravenous demon, will seek his next victim
Your body will tremble with fear
Frozen with horror, paralyzing torture
Your punishment will come severe

He dreams about the night he died, his burning at the stake
Denial of feeble god, repetnance he forsaked
With vengeance he is hunting, for eternity he will slay
All that is sacred, all that is holy
Cursed forever, they shall never rest!!!

Killing and burning, impaling, destroying, disemboweling lambs of the cross
The end is calling, your savoir is falling
Eruption, final holocaust
There is no escaping, the beast is awaitng
Annihilates with one fiendish strike
You can't defy evil, his power to lethal
Determined for the final fight

Can you hear the growling. The moaning from below
The vilent gnashing of the teeth, the cries begin to grow
The demons have awaken, they've come to claim their throne
The mortal lives of those who cheat, deceives they will stone
The pain forever lasting, the mental torture cruel
The burning flesh, the smell of death, the punishment for fools
The skies are raining acid, the molten lava red
The fury of the elements, your final prayer unsaid

Its time to serve your sentence, fear running through your spine
Your body frozen with a numbness, cries from the 8th gate of hell!!!

Stand before the mighty judge, for justice will be served
Your soul is ripe for damning, 1000 deaths deserved
Your body starts to tremble, as the judge stares in your eyes
Impalement for eternity, your soul will never die
Your limbs torn from its torso, the ritual begins
Staring at a lifeless corpse, the terror never ends
No mercy or forgiveness, no pardons for the damned
No one to hear your silent scream, a tear will not be shed

Death forever lurking, the end willnever come
Your fate forever hanging in the putrid bowels of hell
Deadly gas devours, the toxins fill your lungs
The choking death, the burning flesh, to him you will succumb
A slaughter of the traders, for he's the abattoir
The executioner is calling, demon at your door
The reaper has arisen, the hellish demon strikes
He trusts his blade into your flesh, he'll take your soul tonight

The final war the final stand, his revelation is at hand
Death is knoking at your door, your worthless soul he's coming for
From the darkness he will rise, bringing fear into their lives
Slaughtering the lambs of christ, the mortal servants sacrifice

Death, Judgement and Fate, at the masters gate
Before the judge you stand, pathetic righteous man
He will fall, from his throne, the blackened servants of the night will take control
A thousand deaths, you deserve, there's no escaping sentence will be served
He starts to sweat, his body aches, the rider of the blackened horse has sealed your fate
On you knees, you will plead, on your day of judgement there is no mercy

Infernal legions storm the earth, their evil prophecy gives birth
A fallen angel leads the way, from the pit he's come toslay
Fires rage the waters rise, christianity's demise
Heed the powers of the black, viciously they will attack

He mounts his famished horse, with hades close behind
His sword in hand he summons beasts, with pestilence he will ride
His triumph is at hand, he leads you into death
There is no place to run or hide, for this your final breath

Born of heaven, riased in hell, burning cross the demon's spell
Angels lying dead, decayed, the prophecy immense dismay
Pandemonium arrives, broken hope and hole lies
The faithful masses gone astray, everlasting suffering

Into fire he will fly, the emperor's orders obeyed
Sacrificial suicide, as he takes his final dive
Burst the flames the bitter end, wnds divine

Speeds of the runway, and into his fate

Apocalypse upon us, the age of fire is here
The world will burn, it's evil's turn, satanic rule is near
The omen lord from years that passed has risen from his grave
A thirst for war that never ends, the blood shall spill again
His hunger ever yearning as he searched for his prey
An appetite without an end, with knife in hand he slays
The master of the underworld, the darkest angel king
He'll take your life and steal your life the beast immortal king

Lightning and thunder will strike and the hammer shall reign
Son of the damned, child of the wrath
Lightning and thunder will strike as the slaughter begins
Chalice of blood, flows through his veins

The fire burning in his eyes, with vengeance he awaits
Lurking in the darkness for another soul to waste
Preying on deceivers, preying on the lambs of christ
His fiendish howl church through your bowels, its time for you to die
Your god he does not listen, so there is so need to pray
You'll smolder for eternity, to whither and decay
He stands within the circle as he walks the fiery left
Devouring, annihilating children of the lamb

The maggits shall awaken, they are crawling from their nest
To feast upon the fallen souls, a banquet of the flesh
The flames they will consume the liars, choke as they await
They look into the mirror as the beast chooses their fate
You will burn for all etrnity, impaled upon a cross
He'll tear your limbs and gnaw your bones, for his ecstasy
The sinner cries, the sinner dies, there is no god to forgive
Eternal life, eternal death, you will never rise again

Tormented mind and soul, a dream of my own holocaust

Drifting in a blackened sea
There is no sign of life, a soul cannot be seen

Children of god you are thieves, you stole my childhood from me
Sermon of lies and pain, memories of everlasting hate
These mental scars remain, I rose above your agony
Existence I detest, infernally I blaspheme you

Born unto faith, forced to obey, righteous and holy desire
Burden with grief, eternal belief, never to question his word
I choose to die, that live your lie, leave me to drift in this sea
The damage is done, forgotten son, infernally io blaspheme thee
Anger and pain, emotional drain, unanswered prayers far too late
Given you all, only to fall, the knowledge and lessons I've learned
Escape from the light, into the night, bound for my earthy return
I will survive, without a god, I will decide my own fate

We are the servants, sworn to the black, we walk the path of the left
The hordes of chaos will steal your last breath, their is no escape

The storm raging, raging in our minds, rages forever
Never, we will never fail, we won't surrender
Thunder, from the skies you can't deny the power
Prowl'n, in the night its our witching hour

Metal, feel the firestorm its our desire
Burning, feeding on our hearts it fuels the fire
Chosen, from the east, forbidden beasts of chaos
Poser, we will crush its our evil lust for violence

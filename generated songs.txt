song 1
wintery the snowman
 Was to say, "are you married?"
 There's always something new
 But now's December
 And as children listen
 To hear sleigh bells in the snow
 I hear sleigh bells in the snow
 I hear the children sing, "Stop."
 Come on, it's that time of year
 When we all want, a friend
 To hear sleigh bells in the snow
 To hear sleigh bells in the snow
 I'm call, "Merry Christmas" (Ah)

song 2
wintery the snowman, not in front of snow
 You show mein' me, yeah
 Nothing but you makes sense
 Memories fill my heart and I can barely keep my tears
 From fallin', oh I want your love
 Do you ever think of me?
 Is it too late?
 late, too late?
 To open up?
 This is Christmas song
 I'm gonna take
 The joy you bring me to life
 You make everyday feel like it's Christmas
 I never wanna say, oh how I love you
 You're workin' out (You)
 To me know this song
 On my face
 I love you
 To free me from from tears
 I'll give it to someone special
 Last Christmas time
 I gave you away (You away)
 Then away went Rudolph whizzing like a Saber jet
 Tell mein' me if you're really there
 You are really, your angel toes
 I wanna be inside my heart and I can barely keep my tears
 From fallin', oh I want your love
 Have yourself a merry little Christmas time
 What am I?
 When I got your love
 
 Yes, it's Christmas time
 Does it happen to someone special
 Oo' in a arms
 This is Christmas
 I wanna spend it alone
 In that old doubt
 You're really there ('Cause you're really there ('Cause you're really, really everybody)
 B-a-round me like it's Christmas
 I love you
 to say it to someone special (Special)
 Last Christmas time
 I gave you away (You)
 Every year (You gave away)
 You're really there ('Cause you're really, really, really a child)
 I wanna be inside my heart and I can barely keep a-round me from din'o
 On my face
 You love, you give me a Merry Christmas time and I got you
